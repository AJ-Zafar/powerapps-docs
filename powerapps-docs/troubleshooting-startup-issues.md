# Troubleshooting startup issues for Power Apps

This troubleshooting article helps fix common configuration problems that prevent [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com) from starting.

## Common errors

- When you receive the following error message related to cookie settings:

    ```
    Hmmm... Something went wrong.
    thirdPartyCookiesBlocked
    Please enable third party-cookies and site data in your browser settings. If you are using Chrome's Incognito mode, you can uncheck the 'Block third-party cookies' option on the Incognito langing page.
    Try again
    ```

    **Resolution**: [Enable third-party cookies and local data](#enable-storage-of-third-party-cookies-and-local-data-in-your-browser).

- When you sign in to Power Apps - especially using the *InPrivate* or *incognito* experience, you receive the following error:

    ```
    Sign in required
    Please select sign in to continue.
    Session ID: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
    
    AADSTS50058: A silent sign-in request was sent but no user is signed in. The cookies used to represent the user's session were not sent in the request to Azure AD. This can happen if the user is using Internet Explorer or Edge, and the web app sending the silent sign-in request is in different IE security zone than the Azure AD endpoint (login.microsoftonline.com).
    Trace ID: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
    Correlation ID: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
    Timestamp: xxxx-xx-xx xx:xx:xxZ

    ```

    **Resolution**: [Enable third-party cookies and local data](#enable-storage-of-third-party-cookies-and-local-data-in-your-browser).

- When you receive a “Hmmm … We couldn’t sign you in” error message and identifier that resembles the following image:

    ![Hmmm … We couldn’t sign you in. The information below may be helpful](maker/media/troubleshooting-startup-issues/error.png "Hmmm … We couldn’t sign you in. The information below may be helpful")

    **Resolution**: Check [Resolutions for common errors](#resolutions-for-common-errors) for different error variations and resolutions.

## Enable storage of third-party cookies and local data in your browser

Power Apps stores some data such as user identity and preferences locally in your browser. Problems occur if the browser blocks storage of such local data, or third-party cookies set by Power Apps.

Most browsers allow settings to reflect the changes immediately. You may also close all the browser windows and reopen instead.

## Azure Active Directory Errors

The error page that you see might contain additional information that can help diagnose and fix the problem.
