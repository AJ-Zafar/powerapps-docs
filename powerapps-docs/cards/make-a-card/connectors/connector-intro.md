# Connectors (Preview)

[!INCLUDE[cards_preview_notice](../../includes/preview-include.md)]

Connectors are an important part of Power Apps, allowing your card to talk to other apps, data, and devices in the cloud.

For more information on Connectors in Power Platform, see [Connectors overview](/connectors/connectors).

## Prerequisites

- A [Power Apps](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/) account.
- A card to add connectors to. For an example see the [simple card tutorial](../../tutorials/hello-world-card.md).
- Familiarity with the [Card Designer](../make-a-card/designer-overview.md).

## Access connectors in cards

To access connectors in cards, take the following steps:

1. Go to [Power Apps](https://make.test.powerapps.com/) and select **Cards (preview)**.
1. On the left select **Cards** to see all of your cards. Select the card you want to test add a connector to.
1. On the left select **Data**. Then select **+ Add data**. You'll then be able to add a data source and see all available connectors.

## Types of connectors

Within Teams, only connections to Dataverse are available. You can connect to Dataverse tables for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records.

Learn how to [create a card with data from Dataverse](../../tutorials/dataverse-card.md).

The other connectors are available within the Card Designer as they work in the Play page. You can use the Play page to share card instances and experiment with different data connections.
