# Connectors

Connectors are an important part of Power Apps, allowing your card to talk to other apps, data, and devices in the cloud.

For more information on Connectors in Power Platform, see [Connectors overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/connectors).

## Types of connectors

Within Teams, only connections to Dataverse are available. You can connect to Dataverse tables for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records.
