# Use screens (Preview)

[!INCLUDE[cards_preview_notice](../../includes/preview-include.md)]

Cards can have multiple screens that a user can navigate between using the **Back** and **Navigate** formulas or with a **Show Screen** type button. These screens can be used to show different UI for specific scenarios. For example, a polling card might have a screen to collect user responses and a screen to show the current aggregated poll results.

## Tree view

You can view the screens in your card and change properties of each screen using the tree view in the Card Designer.
