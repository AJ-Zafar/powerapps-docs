# Cards glossary

The table below is a glossary of terminology related to cards.

| Term | Description |
| - | - |
| card | A lightweight, data-driven, interactive UI that can be sent in Teams |
| card definition | JSON representation of a card that is stored in Dataverse, including all the controls, their properties, the screens, formulas, data connections, and more. |
| Card Designer | Where you author cards. See [Designer overview](/make-a-card/designer-overview.md). |
| card instance | When a card definition is played, that card definition is turned into a card instance by populating the data from connections, taking any variable customizations. Card instances are what you send to other users and can be shared across users and clients, like Teams or the Play Page. |
| card session | When a user views a card instance within a specific client like Teams or the Play Page, they're in a card session. Each time the user reloads the card a session starts. A session is for a single user, in a single client, for a single card instance. |
| control | A UI element for a card, like a text label, container, Date input or button. See [controls](/make-a-card/ui-elements/use-controls.md). |
| data connection | A way to bring in data and run actions through services in a secure way. See [connectors](/make-a-card/connectors/connector-intro.md). |
| Data pane | A pane on the left side of the Card Designer where you can add and manage the data connections for a card. |
| Debug pane | A pane on the right side of the Play Page that lets the user see information about the card, like what the variables are set to, what connections are available, what the current card JSON looks like. |
| formula | An expression used to define business logic within a card, like calculating values, updating variables, or changing data sources from connections. See [formulas](/make-a-card/power-fx/intro-to-pfx.md). |
| Formula bar | A bar along the top of the Card Designer used to change properties or write formulas. |
| Insert pane | A pane on the left side of the Card Designer where you can see the controls available to add into a card. |
| JSON view | A pane on the right side of the Card Designer where you can see the card definition in its JSON representation. |
| Play Page | A place to play cards; it can be used to either validate cards during the authoring process or to share cards on the web. |
| screen | A set of controls put together for a user to interact with. A card can have multiple screens. See [screens](/make-a-card/screens/understand-screens.md). |
| Tree view | A pane on the left side of the Card Designer where you can see the hierarchical structure of the card, including screens and controls. |
| variable | A way to store data within the context of card. See [variables](/make-a-card/variables/variables.md). |
