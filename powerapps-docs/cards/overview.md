# Cards Overview

Cards are a low-code capability of Power Apps enabling business users and developers to design, send, and use cards - micro-apps with embedded enterprise data and workflows that can be sent as content in other applications.

Business users and subject matter experts can create cards with a guided, visual graphical interface to optimize and automate business tasks and to create actionable scenarios with interactive, data-driven, lightweight UI and make these cards available for other people to use.

As a part of the Power Apps ecosystem, cards add business logic through Power Fx and integration with business data through Power Platform connectors.

Using cards, you can quickly build, manage, and share rich, actionable UI cards without needing coding or IT expertise.

## Get started in minutes

Cards are available to makers as a part of Power Apps. You can easily sign into the Power Apps maker portal and create your card with a few clicks; there are no complex systems or services to deploy and maintain.

To create a card, you can go to make.powerapps.com and navigate to the Cards section:

There are two key parts to this solution:

- **Card Designer**: a low-code designer for creating new cards using drag-and-drop controls, Power Fx logic, and data from Power Platform connectors

- **Lightweight runtime**: manages sending and receiving cards with embedded data and workflows

## Card Designer

Use the intuitive drag-and-drop Designer to create a card consisting of buttons, tables, text, images, checkboxes, input fields, containers, and many other types of elements without writing any code.

### Add data and connect to services with connectors

Add Power Platform connectors to work with enterprise data and invoke cloud-based functions safely and securely in your cards.

The lightweight runtime of cards securely handles tokens for each participant in the card transaction, enabling data-rich and powerful scenarios that respect security boundaries within an organization.

### Build business logic with actions and calculations

Use Power Fx to add inline calculations and dynamic actions to cards. Create powerful actions, including data operations, and assign them to interactive UI elements in the card.

## Post cards on Teams 
Post cards on Teams to share them with other people by using the **Send** button in the Designer and copying the link into a Teams chat or channel.

## Lightweight Runtime

The card runtime allows users to run their interactive cards with embedded data and workflows. The runtime engine abstracts over the interactive transaction capabilities of card canvases, enabling users to send and receive cards without needing to deploy a secondary bot service or build other apps.
