# Manage cards with DLP policies

The **Cards for Power Apps** connector is used to automatically send cards via Power Automate. [DLP policies](/power-platform/admin/wp-data-loss-prevention) enforce rules for which connectors can be used together with other connectors.

Administrators can use DLP policies to determine which connectors can be used in flows that send cards, for example if both the MSN Weather connector and the Cards for Power Apps connector are classified as **Business**, then makers can send daily status cards with the weather.
