# Work with formula table columns (preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)] More information: [Power Apps preview program](/power-platform/admin/preview-environments)

Formula columns are a new data type in Microsoft Dataverse for Teams that are built on Power Fx. You can add a formula column to a table in real time. The Dataverse table stores the logic and gives you the values during fetch operations. This means you can create the formula and compute the values as you read. Formula columns use syntax similar to that of Office Excel with intellisense that recommends formula, syntax, and errors as you write the formula.

> [!NOTE]
> - Currently, formula columns are only available with Dataverse for Teams environments.
> - Formula columns can be added as a calculated field. Currently, formula columns can't be used in roll-up fields or with plugins.
