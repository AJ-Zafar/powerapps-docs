# When you should create Power Apps in Microsoft Teams

Microsoft Teams was built with the very purpose of enabling collaboration. With over 145 million people using Teams every day, Teams has become the digital platform for work and learning, which makes it a good place for collaborative apps.

Stand-alone Power Apps are great for individual productivity, but if work and communication between people needs to happen in the same place, Teams is a great place for collaborative apps.

The Power Apps template apps for Microsoft Teams are great examples of these types of collaborative apps:

**Apps that provide collaboration and workloads centrally within Microsoft Teams**

-   [Milestones](https://aka.ms/teamsmilestones) enables collaboration on  project work items from within Microsoft Teams.

-   [Bulletins](https://aka.ms/teamsbulletins) enables collaboration by  providing a central place in Microsoft teams for company news, frequently  asked questions (FAQs) and links and contacts.

**Other workloads that leverage deep integration with Microsoft Teams to facilitate collaboration.**

-   [Inspection](https://aka.ms/teamsinspection) enables collaboration by creating tasks in Microsoft Planner and posting messages to a Teams channel  when an inspection is completed.

You might ask why would I want to do inspections in Microsoft Teams? Because inspections require communication and follow-up, so doing them in Microsoft Teams where people are already communicating and collaborating. Since there is a hand-off between personas with an inspections (someone does the inspection, somebody reviews the inspection), having the apps in Microsoft Teams makes sense as that is where collaboration happens.

-   [Issue Reporting](https://aka.ms/teamsissuereporting) enables collaboration  by creating tasks in Microsoft Planner when an issue is reported.

-   [Profile Plus](https://aka.ms/teamsprofileplus) enables collaboration by  making it easy to find other people in your organization, view open positions for which you might want to apply, and start teams calls, chats,  or meetings with colleagues in Microsoft Teams.

-   [Boards]() enables collaboration by facilitating pinning, sharing, and finding bookmarks in Microsoft Teams, including links to Teams, channels, files, and websites.

-   [Perspectives](https://aka.ms/teamsperspectives) enables collaboration and  inclusion by providing a place to listen and be heard in your organization.  While Teams provides a great place to communicate, sometimes communication can get lost. Perspectives makes it each to find interesting discussions and give input on discussions.

So if your app relates to how users interact, work, communicate, and collaborate, Microsoft Teams is a great place to create your Power Apps.
