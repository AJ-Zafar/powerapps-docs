# Comparing Microsoft Lists, Dataverse for Teams, and Dataverse

Whether youâ€™re using Power Apps to build a small app for your team or a mission critical app for your business, there are many great options for data. 

This article focuses on three of the most popular data technologies used in Microsoft Power Platform: Microsoft Lists, Microsoft Dataverse for Teams, and Microsoft Dataverse. With the answers to the questions below, you can quickly understand and apply the key considerations that will help you pick the correct one for your application.

The questions are broken out into four categories: 

|Category |Questions |
|----------|---------|
| Data |What types of data (and how much of it) will your application require?<br/>How do you want to search the data? |
|Application | How will the app be made available, for example in Teams, custom code, etc.?<br/>Will guests be accessing your application?<br/>Who will build the app; low-code or pro developers?<br/>What special capabilities does your application need? |
|Integration |What do you want to integrate the system with, for example, databases, services, etc.? |
|Admin and governance | What are your organizations requirements related to security and compliance?<br/>Are there special requirements for backing up and restoring the data? |
