# Add contact phone in Links and Contacts section

The Bulletins Power Apps sample app for Microsoft Teams provides a central location for all company communication such as broadcasts, memos, announcements, and company news. The app allows you to create, categorize, bookmark, search and read bulletin posts.

The Bulletins app solution consists of two apps:

[**Manage bulletins app**](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/teams/bulletins#manage-bulletins-app)

-   Manager experience for managing **Bulletins** app.

-   Allows managers to create, edit, and categorize posts read through the Bulletins app.

[**Bulletins app**](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/teams/bulletins#bulletins-app)

-   Central location for all company communication such as memos, broadcasts, and news.

-   Shows bulletins, FAQs, links, and contacts created using the **Manage bulletins** app.

In this topic we will learn how to enable users to initiate a call to their contacts from within the app using Teams.

The Bulletins app provides links to relevant contacts in the organization and external to the organization that are relevant to specific categories. For example, if you want to know who is responsible for health insurance benefits, you can add the appropriate contact under the category of health insurance.

By default there is no phone number to call the person. In this topic we will add the ability to call the person from within the app.

NOTE: before starting this topic, please review **How to customize Bulletins** (insert link).

## Prerequisites

To complete this lesson, we would need the ability to login into Microsoft Teams which will be available as part of select Microsoft 365 subscriptions and will also need to have the Bulletins Power Apps template for Microsoft Teams installed. This app can be installed from aka.ms/TeamsBulletins (confirm link). Also, we would need to complete lesson 82 Add "notify me" settings to category (confirm link). We will use steps followed in that lesson and build up on those in this topic.

>NOTE\*\*: The following steps need to be performed on both the Bulletins and the Manage Bulletins apps separately (basically wherever/in whichever app you want the Call contact functionality enabled)

    - OnSelect = Launch("msteams://teams.microsoft.com/l/call/0/0?users="&
        ThisItem.Email,{},LaunchTarget.New)
        
        > NOTE: This is will launch the Teams call option and will open a pop-up and ask if you would like to call the contact via Teams
