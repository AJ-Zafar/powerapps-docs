# Customize apps for end user to add notification preferences

The Bulletins Power Apps template for Microsoft Teams provides a central location for all company communication such as broadcasts, memos, announcements, and company news. The app allows you to create, categorize, bookmark, search and read bulletin posts.

The Bulletins app solution consists of two apps:

[**Manage bulletins app**](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/teams/bulletins#manage-bulletins-app)Manager experience for managing **Bulletins** app.

-   Allows managers to create, edit, and categorize posts read through the Bulletins app.

[**Bulletins app**](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/teams/bulletins#bulletins-app)

-   Central location for all company communication such as memos, broadcasts, and news.
    
-   Shows bulletins, FAQs, links, and contacts created using the **Manage bulletins**  app.

In this topic we will learn how to enable users to set notification preferences per category for which they want to get notified when new bulletins get added.

> NOTE: before starting this topic, please review **How to customize Bulletins** (insert link).

## Prerequisites

This app can be installed from aka.ms/TeamsBulletins (confirm link). Also, we would need to complete lesson 82 Add "notify me" settings to category (confirm link).

   - X = Parent.Width - Self.Width - 20.

   - Y = lblGalBulletins_ByCategory_Name.Y

   - Items = Choices('Preference (Bulletin Notifications)')

   - Tooltip = "Notification Preference"

   - Visible = Toggle1.Checked

   - OnChange = Patch('Bulletin Notifications',LookUp('Bulletin Notifications',Category.'Bulletin Category'=ThisItem.appCategoryGUID&&'User
     ID'.User=gblUserRecord.User),{Preference:Self.Selected.Value})

   *(This Patch function is to save the selected preference on the record in the Bulletin Notifications table)*  

   1.  Default = LookUp('Bulletin Notifications',Category.'Bulletin Category'=ThisItem.appCategoryGUID&&'User 
       ID'.User=gblUserRecord.User).Preference

8.  Now, select the Toggle1 control *(that was added as part of the* **Add "notify me" settings to category** *lesson)*
