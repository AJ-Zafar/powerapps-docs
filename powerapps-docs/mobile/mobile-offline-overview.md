# Overview of mobile offline (preview)

Wouldn't it be great to use your mobile app without worrying about a spotty internet connection? With model-driven Power Apps, it's possiable. People that need to work from remote locations can continue to work seamlessly without worrying connectivity. 

When model-driven apps are enabled for mobile offline, not only can you continue doing your work, you'll also have better device performance, a more resonsive app, and it'll save battery power with less connections made to the server. 

Note, internet connection is required to sync data between your mobile device and Microsoft Dataverse.

To get started with mobile offline, an app maker will need to enable and define the tables that will be available for offline use in Dataverse. For more information, see [Set up mobile offline](setup-mobile-offline.md)


## Offline first

Once offline is configured anyone that uses [Power Apps mobile](run-powerapps-on-mobile) can also use it in offline mode. The Power Apps mobile always runs offline-first, both with and without internet connection. This functionality optimizes performance and creates a consistent experience for users as they move through areas with and without internet connection. 

1.	**Online**: Occurs when there is internet but and offline isn't set up. When internet is lost, the mobile app is unusable. Not recommended.
2.	**Offline first without internet connection**: Data is downloaded to the device and all changes are saved locally to your mobile device. When internet is restored, the changes are automatically synced to the server.
3. **Offline first with internet connection**: Data is downloaded to the device and all changes are saved locally; but because there is internet connection the app will automatically attempt to sync every few minutes.



> [!IMPORTANT]
> This topic covers the new offline set up experience using the [modern app designer](../maker/model-driven-apps/create-model-driven-app) and the new [offline first experience](link TBD).
>   - Run all your model-driven apps on [Power Apps mobile](run-powerapps-on-mobile) including customer engagement apps (such as [Dynamics 365 Sales](/dynamics365/sales-professional/help-hub.md), [Dynamics 365 Customer Service](/dynamics365/customer-service/help-hub.md), and [Dynamics 365 Marketing](/dynamics365/marketing/help-hub.md)). However, the new experience also works with [Dynamics 365 for Phones and Tablets](/dynamics365/mobile-app/overview) and [Field Service (Dynamics 365) mobile app](/dynamics365/field-service/mobile-2020-power-platform).
