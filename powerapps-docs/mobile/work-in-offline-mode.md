# Offline-first (preview)

This topic covers the new offline-first user experience. Once [offline is enabled](setup-mobile-offline.md) for your model-driven app, you can run it one of the following mobile apps:

- [Power Apps mobile](run-powerapps-on-mobile)
- [Dynamics 365 for Phones and Tablets](/dynamics365/mobile-app/overview)
- [Field Service (Dynamics 365) mobile app](/dynamics365/field-service/mobile-2020-power-platform)

Depending on the app youâ€™re using and your set up, your offline experience may be different. 


## Offline-first vs. classic offline

With the new offline-first experience it's important to understand the key benifits of the new vs. the [classic offline experience](/dynamics365/mobile-app/work-in-offline-mode). 



|Offline-first| Classic offline  |
|---------|---------|
| <ol><li>Your data is always the same regardless of your network connection. </lo> <div></div> <div></div> !![Download offline data.](media/offline-first-classic-3.png) <li> There no toggle for users to switch form offline to online mode. A user will never forget to sync their changes back to the server because the app will do it automatically. <div></div> ![Sync data back to server.](media/offline-first-classic-4.png) </li>     |   <ol> <li> Users have the options to skip the initial offline sync and stay online which means user in your organization won't have the same experiences. <div></div> ![Download offline data.](media/offline-first-classic-1.png) </li> <li> The Work in offline mode toggle is something a user has to remember to disable to sync back all your changes with the server. <div></div> ![Download offline data.](media/offline-first-classic-2.png) </li> <div></div> </li> <li> When there's no network, the rows are listed from the local database so they won't be the same when you connect back to the server. If you lose internet connection while editing an online mode and suddenly lose connection then you will also lose your changes when you tro to save them while offline. </li>  |

5. On the **Upcoming** tab, set the **Disable classic offline** toggle to **On**.

6. Close the **Settings** dialog and then save and publish the app.


Some of the features such as dashboards, charts, multi-table business process flows, and server-side sync are only available when you're online. Be sure to validate your app and make sure that it's fully functional be you deploy it. 

## Use offline-first

For your app to be available offline, it needs to download the app and user data on the device first. This process is called initial offline sync.
The app data includes all the resources needed for the app to run properly and the user data configured in the offline profile and stored in Microsoft Dataverse tables.

With offline-first, during the initial offline sync, you'll get a notification stating that your app is syncing the offline data. This can take a few minutes or even more depending on what has been configured in the offline profile. The initial offline sync is triggered everything when the app is launched. Select **See details** to open the offline status page.

You can also select the **Offline status** button to see more information about sync progress.

> ![Offline status screen.](media/offline-first-2.png)


When the sync is complete, you can start using your application offline. Depending on the sync intervals set up in the offline profile, all subsequent syncs will happen automatically.
