# Switch to a different directory on Power Apps mobile

When a user signs into Power Apps, they sign into their *home tenant*, which is the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant where their credentials are provisioned. After signing in, a user can change the *directory*, or organization they intend to use the app with. 

Users can now easily switch to a different directory, without having to log out of Power Apps, when using Power Apps on mobile devices. Users can specify the directory they want to work in on the user profile page.  This means that:

- Users no longer need to sign out of Power Apps to switch directories.
- Users can now access shared apps from a list on the user profile page.

> [!Important]
> The ability to easily switch to a different directory is available on only Android devices at this time.

To switch to a different directory on Power Apps mobile:

1. Open Power Apps on your mobile device.
2. From the **Home**, **All apps**, or **More** page, select your profile image. Your user profile page appears.
3. Select the directory you're signed in to. A list of directories appears.
    
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![A list of directories.](media/tenant-switcher.png "A list of directories.")
   
4. Select the directory you want to switch to.
