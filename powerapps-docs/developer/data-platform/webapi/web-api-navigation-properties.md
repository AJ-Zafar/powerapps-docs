# Web API Navigation Properties

Within the [CSDL $metadata document](web-api-service-documents.md#csdl-metadata-document), each entity type that is not abstract will have `NavigationProperty` elements.

The `NavigationProperty` element describes data related to the current entity type. When you retrieve a record, you can expand navigation properties to include related data.

`NavigationProperty` elements have the following attributes:


|Attribute |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|`Name`|The name of the navigation property. This value is case sensitive.|
|`Type`|The related entity type. This can be to a single value or a collection of a type.|
|`Partner`|The name of the navigation property on the other side of the relationship.|
|`Nullable="false"`|Whether the value can be null.|

There are two types of navigation properties: ***single-valued*** and ***collection-valued***. This distinction is important because capabilities for each type of navigation property are different.

## Single-valued navigation properties

When a navigation property Type refers to a single value, it represents a many-to-one relationship to set a reference to another table record. This is commonly called a 'lookup'. For example, this is the `account` table `createdby` navigation property:

```xml
<NavigationProperty 
    Name="createdby" 
    Type="mscrm.systemuser" 
    Nullable="false" 
    Partner="lk_accountbase_createdby">
    <ReferentialConstraint 
        Property="_createdby_value" 
        ReferencedProperty="systemuserid" />
</NavigationProperty>
```

This single-valued navigation property connects multiple `account` records to a single `systemuser` record. Each `systemuser` record will have a collection-valued navigation property named `lk_accountbase_createdby` that connects them to the `account` records they have created.

### Lookup properties

Single-valued navigation properties will also have a `ReferentialConstraint` with a `Property` attribute that refers to a ***lookup property*** using the following naming convention: `_<name>_value`. 

The `ReferentialConstraint` will also have a `ReferencedProperty` attribute that identifies the primary key name of the related entity type.

With [Metadata annotations](web-api-service-documents.md#metadata-annotations) enabled, a lookup property looks like this:

```xml
<Property Name="_createdby_value" Type="Edm.Guid">
    <Annotation Term="Org.OData.Core.V1.Description" String="Shows who created the record." />
    <Annotation Term="Org.OData.Core.V1.Computed" Bool="true" />
    <Annotation Term="Org.OData.Core.V1.Permissions">
        <EnumMember>Org.OData.Core.V1.PermissionType/Read</EnumMember>
    </Annotation>
</Property>
```

These lookup properties are computed, read-only properties that have an `Edm.Guid` value. You can use these lookup properties in a query filter to match all the records associated to the single record in the many-to-one relationship.

In most cases the `<name>` will match the name of the navigation property. However, when the single-valued navigation property is part of a multi-table (or polymorphic) lookup there may be a single lookup property which is the `ReferentialConstraint` for more than one single-valued navigation property. 

An entity type may have something like the following combination of a `_customerid_value` lookup property and a multiple single-valued navigation properties that represent a multi-table lookup. There will be one single-valued navigation property for each type of table supported by the multi-table lookup.

```xml
<EntityType Name="socialprofile" BaseType="mscrm.crmbaseentity">
    <Key>
        <PropertyRef Name="socialprofileid" />
    </Key>
    <Property Name="_customerid_value" Type="Edm.Guid">
        <Annotation Term="Org.OData.Core.V1.Description" String="Shows the customer that this social profile belongs to." />
    </Property>
    <NavigationProperty Name="customerid_contact" Type="mscrm.contact" Nullable="false" Partner="Socialprofile_customer_contacts">
        <ReferentialConstraint Property="_customerid_value" ReferencedProperty="contactid" />
    </NavigationProperty>
    <NavigationProperty Name="customerid_account" Type="mscrm.account" Nullable="false" Partner="Socialprofile_customer_accounts">
        <ReferentialConstraint Property="_customerid_value" ReferencedProperty="accountid" />
    </NavigationProperty>
</EntityType>
```

In these cases, setting the value of any of the single-valued navigation properties will set all the other participating single-valued navigation properties to null.

When you include lookup properties in a query, you can request annotations to be included that provide additional information about the data that is set for those underlying attributes which arenâ€™t represented by a single-valued navigation property. More information: [Retrieve data about lookup properties](query-data-web-api.md#retrieve-data-about-lookup-properties).


## Collection-valued navigation properties

When a navigation property `Type` refers to a collection value, it represents a one-to-many or many-to-many relationship. For example, this is the account entity `Account_Tasks` navigation property.

```xml
<NavigationProperty 
    Name="Account_Tasks" 
    Type="Collection(mscrm.task)" 
    Partner="regardingobjectid_account_task" 
/>
```

This navigation property connects an account record to many task records. Each task has a single-valued navigation property named `regardingobjectid_account_task` that refers to the account as the regarding object.

When the `Name` and the `Partner` of the collection-valued navigation property are the same, it represents a many-to-many relationship.

### Many-to-Many Relationships

The way you work with collection-valued navigation properties using the Web API is the same regardless of whether the relationship is a one-to-many or many-to-many relationship. Both are considered collections, but many-to-many relationships have some implementation details you can find in the service documents. For most use cases, you can ignore them.

For example, every many-to-many relationship has an ***intersect table*** which supports it. These intersect tables have entity types that typically have just 4 read-only properties. The following is an example of an entity type for an intersect table that supports a many-to-many relationship between customer and product tables.

```xml
<EntityType Name="new_customer_product" BaseType="mscrm.crmbaseentity">
    <Key>
        <PropertyRef Name="new_customer_productid" />
    </Key>
    <Property Name="new_customerid" Type="Edm.Guid" />
    <Property Name="versionnumber" Type="Edm.Int64"/>
    <Property Name="new_customer_productid" Type="Edm.Guid"/>
    <Property Name="new_productid" Type="Edm.Guid"/>
</EntityType>
```

You can't work with entity types that represent intersect tables directly because all the properties are read-only. Perform operations on the collection-valued navigation properties.
