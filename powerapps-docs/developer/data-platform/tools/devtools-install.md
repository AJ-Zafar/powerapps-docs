# Install Power Platform Tools

This topic describes the pre-requisites for the Power Platform Tools (PPT) extension for Visual Studio, and how to install and uninstall the extension. The Visual Studio extension supports the rapid creation and deployment of plug-ins and custom workflow activities, integration technologies like Azure Service endpoints and Web Hooks, and more.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> While the Power Platform Tools extension for Visual Studio is similar in appearance and function to the Developer Toolkit for Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2013, Power Platform Tools is a new product and completely independent of the Developer Toolkit. Power Platform Tools is not directly compatible with any templates or projects from the Developer Toolkit and vice versa.
