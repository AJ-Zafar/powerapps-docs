# Use open types with Custom APIs

An _open type_ is a structured type that can have dynamic properties. Most types that are defined in Dataverse are _closed types_. With closed types, every property name and type value is known. If you use the wrong name, or set the value to the wrong type you get an error. Normally, this structure is a good thing, but sometimes your business logic requires a more flexible approach.

When you create a Dataverse message using Custom API, you can specify the names and types of each of the request parameters and response properties. There are currently [13 different types to choose from](/power-apps/developer/data-platform/reference/entities/customapirequestparameter#type-choicesoptions) so you can create closed types that the system knows about and can validate for you. But closed types aren't dynamic or allow for complex and nested properties.

## Use JSON strings or open types

You don't need to use open types. You can define define request parameters and response properties as strings and require callers to pass JSON data as the value. You can return any kind of JSON data as the value of a string response property. When you do this, your plug-in code must deserialize the JSON received and serialize the JSON to return. Your code is responsible for validating the JSON data received and returning useful error messages when the data is invalid.

If your Custom API represents a customizable business operation, you will enable other developers to register steps for your plug-in. Those developers will also need to deserialize the JSON to work with the data in the message. If they need to change any values, they will need to serialize that data again to set the value.

Serialization and deserialization are expensive operations and should be avoided. When strings are large, they can have a significant impact on performance.

The advantage of using open types is that you can use existing Dataverse types to compose the data structures you want to use. Developers using your custom apis with the Dataverse SDK for .NET can use the [Entity](xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Entity) class to compose requests and process responses. There is no need for serialization and deserialization within your plug-in code, or anyone else who extends the logic of your custom api in their plug-ins.

In either case, Dataverse doesn't know the details of the data structures you are using. As the API developer, you are responsible for documenting these structures and providing any helper classes to enable callers to be successful using your API. More information: [Recommendations](#recommendations)

## How to use open types

To use open types you need a message that is configured for them. With Custom API you specify that a request parameter or response property is open by setting the `Type` to **Entity** (3) or **EntityCollection** (4) _without_ specifying a `LogicalEntityName`.

When you do this, you are telling Dataverse that the **Entity** is a collection of key/value pairs that can't be validated against any table definition, so it won't try. An **EntityCollection** without a `LogicalEntityName` is just an array of **Entity**.

> [!NOTE]
> Custom API defined as _functions_ can't use open types as request parameters, but may use them as response properties.

### Use Dataverse entities

While not actually an open type, it is worth mentioning that you can have a custom API with parameters or response properties that represent more than one possible closed entity types. For example, you can create a Custom API with a `Customer` parameter that expects either `Account` or `Contact` entity instances. Dataverse will allow *any* entity type. Your plug-in code must check the [Entity.LogicalName](xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Entity.LogicalName) value to determine whether it is a type you expect.

### Use Entity as a dictionary

The more common case is to use the Entity as a dictionary. Use the [Entity.Attributes](xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Entity.Attributes) collection to specify a set of keys and values. The values can be any .NET type and can be nested. Other Entity class properties and methods are not used.

Let's say that your application uses data that comes from or will be sent to Microsoft Graph and represents the [educationSchool resource type](/graph/api/resources/educationschool). You might use an open type like the following examples.

# [SDK for .NET](#tab/sdk)

To use an open type with the SDK, simply use the [Entity](xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Entity) class without specifying the entity name, then set the [Entity.Attributes](xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Entity.Attributes) collection with the keys and the values.

```csharp
var educationSchool = new Entity() {
    Attributes =
    {
        { "id", Guid.NewGuid() },
        { "displayName","Redmond STEM Academy" },
        { "phone", "555-1234" },
        { "address",  new Entity() //physicalAddress resource type
            {
            Attributes =
                {
                    { "city","Redmond" },
                    { "countryOrRegion","United States" },
                    { "postalCode","98008" },
                    { "state","Washington" },
                    { "street","123 Maple St" },
                }
            }
        }
    }
};
```

# [Web API](#tab/webapi)

To use an open type when using Web API, you must set the `@odata.type` annotation value to `Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.expando`. This represents the [expando EntityType](xref:Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.expando), which has no properties and inherits from the [crmbaseentity EntityType](xref:Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.crmbaseentity).

```json
{
  "@odata.type": "Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.expando",
  "id@odata.type": "Guid",
  "id": "59fab58c-46f9-425c-b32d-43726fb6e95b",
  "displayName@odata.type": "String",
  "displayName": "Redmond STEM Academy",
  "phone@odata.type": "String",
  "phone": "555-1234",
  "address": {
    "@odata.type": "Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.expando",
    "city@odata.type": "String",
    "city": "Redmond",
    "countryOrRegion@odata.type": "String",
    "countryOrRegion": "United States",
    "state@odata.type": "String",
    "state": "Washington",
    "street@odata.type": "String",
    "street": "123 Maple St"
  }
}
```

Notice that the `id` value has an `id@odata.type` annotation. This is necessary to specify that the value represents a <xref:System.Guid> rather than a <xref:System.String>. Unless specified, OData will expect that the simplest JSON type is intended.

If the value is a number it will be expected to be a `Int32`. If the value is `Decimal`, `Double`, `Int16`, or `Int64`, you must specify this using the `<property name>@odata.type` annotation.

> [!NOTE]
> Notice that each of the string values also has an annotation to specify that they are strings. This is a mitigation against a known issue in OData [https://github.com/OData/odata.net/issues/764](https://github.com/OData/odata.net/issues/764). If the string value contains an open bracket '`[`' or single quote '`'`', the OData library will return an error like the following `Microsoft.OData.ODataException: Found an unbalanced bracket expression.`. Unless you are certain that the values sent will never include these characters, you must include the `"<property name>@odata.type": "String"` annotation to prevent this error.

If the value is an array, you must always include an annotation using this pattern: `"<property name>@odata.type": "Collection(<type>)"`

For example:

```json
{
  "@odata.type": "Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.expando",
   "stringArray": ["one","two","three"],
   "stringArray@odata.type": "Collection(String)",
   "intarray": [1,2,3],
   "intarray@odata.type": "Collection(Int32)"
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Please see the known issue: [Error using Array data with Web API](#error-using-array-data-with-web-api)

### Use Dataverse types

In addition to basic .NET types, you can also use types known to Dataverse. The SDK for .NET contains definitions of many classes that Dataverse knows about, and in the Web API these are listed among the Web API [Complex Type Reference](xref:Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.ComplexTypeIndex) and [Enum Type Reference](xref:Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.EnumTypeIndex).

When using the SDK, you can simply set the values.

When using Web API, you must specify the type using the Web API namespace: `Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM`. For example:

```json
{
  "@odata.type": "Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.expando",
  "label@odata.type": "Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.LocalizedLabel",
   "label": {      
      "Label": "Yes",
      "LanguageCode": 1033
   },
  "labelarray": [
    {
      "@odata.type": "Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.LocalizedLabel",
      "Label": "test",
      "LanguageCode": 1033
    },
    {
      "@odata.type": "Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.LocalizedLabel",
      "Label": "pr√∏ve",
      "LanguageCode": 1030
    }
  ],
  "labelarray@odata.type": "Collection(Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.LocalizedLabel)",
  "enumarray": ["DateOnly"],
  "enumarray@odata.type": "Collection(Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.DateTimeFormat)"
}

```

## Recommendations

Open types allow for dynamic and unstructured data. But you should consider whether your API has truly dynamic parameters or if you actually want to have a custom type.

Currently, you can't define a custom type that Dataverse knows about. But using open types you can define a class that Dataverse can process as an open type. Developers using your Custom API can use your classes to have a better, more productive experience using your custom api without less opportunity for errors.

For example, let's say that your custom api requires a parameter that tracks a course using an array of points.

# [SDK for .NET](#tab/sdk)

You can create a `Location` class that inherits from the [Entity](xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Entity) class and contains the properties you need for example:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk;

namespace MyCompany
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Specifies a location for use with my_CustomAPI
    /// </summary>
    public class Location : Entity
    {
        // Gets or sets the latitude of the Location.
        [AttributeLogicalName("Latitude")]
        public double Latitude
        {
            get
            {
                return GetAttributeValue<double>("Latitude");
            }
            set
            {
                SetAttributeValue("Latitude", value);
            }
        }

        // Gets or sets the longitude of the Location.
        [AttributeLogicalName("Longitude")]
        public double Longitude
        {
            get
            {
                return GetAttributeValue<double>("Longitude");
            }
            set
            {
                SetAttributeValue("Longitude", value);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Because this type inherits from the `Entity` class, it can use the `Entity` methods with to access the values in the `Attributes` collection. You can use this class within your plug-in code and share it with consumers a library or in sample code in your documentation.

The result is code that is easier to use and read.

**Before**

```csharp
var location = new Entity() { 
   Attributes =
   {
      { "Latitude", 47.66132951804776 },
      { "Longitude", -122.11446844957624},            
   }            
};

// OR 

var location = new Entity();
location["Latitude"] = 47.66132951804776;
location["Longitude"] = -122.11446844957624;
```

**After**

```csharp
var location = new Location { 
   Latitude = 47.66132951804776,
   Longitude = -122.11446844957624
};
```

# [Web API](#tab/webapi)

Because Web API can be used with .NET and other programming languages, the specific method will depend on the language and the technologies you will use to work with JSON.

When using [Json.NET](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json) with C#, you can define a class like this:

```csharp
using Newtonsoft.Json;

namespace MyCompany
{
    public class Location 
    {
        [JsonProperty("@odata.type")]
        public string ODataType => "Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.expando";

        // Gets or sets the latitude of the GeoCoordinate.
        public double? Latitude { get; set; }

        [JsonProperty("Latitude@odata.type")]
        public static string LatitudeType => "Double";

        // Gets or sets the longitude of the GeoCoordinate.
        public double? Longitude { get; set; }

        [JsonProperty("Longitude@odata.type")]
        public static string LongitudeType => "Double";
    }
}

```

When a developer uses this class, they don't need to worry about setting the `@odata.type` annotations.

```csharp
Location location = new() {
   Latitude = 47.66132951804776,
   Longitude = -122.11446844957624
};
```

The `@odata.type` annotations will always be included:

```json
{
    "@odata.type": "Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.expando",
    "Latitude": 47.66132951804776,
    "Latitude@odata.type": "Double",
    "Longitude": -122.11446844957624,
    "Longitude@odata.type": "Double"
}
```

## Known issues

The following are known issues using open types:

### Error using Array data with Web API

When sending data that contains an array using Web API, the following error will occur when the custom api has a plug-in:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "0x80040224",
    "message": "Element 'http://schemas.datacontract.org/2004/07/System.Collections.Generic:value' contains data from a type
     that maps to the name 'System.Collections.Generic:List`1'. The deserializer has no knowledge of any type that maps to 
     this name. Consider changing the implementation of the ResolveName method on your DataContractResolver to return a 
     non-null value for name 'List`1' and namespace 'System.Collections.Generic'.",
  }
}
```

This error doesn't occur when the client application is using the SDK for .NET.
