# Bypass Custom Business Logic

There are times when you want to be able to perform data operations without having custom business logic applied. For example, if you are going to import a lot of records which you know already conform to the data consistency logic for your business. You want this operation to be done as quickly as possible, so the additional time spent processing custom logic for each request is something you want to avoid.  

For these kinds of situations, you have the option to disable custom business logic which would normally be applied. There are two requirements:

- You must send the requests using the `BypassCustomPluginExecution` option.
- The user sending the requests must have the `prvBypassCustomPlugins` privilege. By default, only users with the system administrator security role have this privilege.

> [!NOTE]
> The `prvBypassCustomPlugins` is not available to be assigned in the UI at this time. You can add a privilege to a security role using the API.

## What does this do?

This solution targets the custom business logic that has been applied for your organization. When you send requests that bypass custom business logic, all plug-ins and workflows are disabled except:

- Plug-ins which are part of the core Microsoft Dataverse system or part of a solution where Microsoft is the publisher.
- Workflows included in a solution where Microsoft is the publisher.

System plug-ins define the core behaviors for specific entities. Without these plug-ins you would encounter data inconsistencies that may not be easily fixed.

Solutions shipped by Microsoft that use Dataverse such as Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Service, or Dynamics 365 Sales also include critical business logic that cannot be bypassed with this option.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You may have purchased and installed solutions from other Independant Software Vendors (ISVs) which include their own business logic. The logic applied by these solutions will be bypassed. You should check with these ISVs before you use this option to understand what impact there may be if you use this option with data that their solutions use.

## How do I use the BypassCustomPluginExecution option?

You can use this option with either the Web API or the Organization service.

### Using the Web API

To apply this option using the Web API, pass `MSCRM.BypassCustomPluginExecution : true` as a header in the request.

**Example request:**

The following Web API request will create a new account record without custom business logic applied:

```http
POST https://yourorg.api.crm.dynamics.com/api/data/v9.1/accounts HTTP/1.1
MSCRM.BypassCustomPluginExecution: true
Authorization: Bearer [REDACTED]
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: */*

{
  "name":"Test Account"
}
```


### Using the Organization Service

There are two ways to use this with the Organization Service.

#### You can set CrmServiceClient.BypassPluginExecution Property to true

> [!NOTE]
> There is a problem using this method at the time of this writing. It should be fixed soon.

The following example sets the [CrmServiceClient.BypassPluginExecution Property](/dotnet/api/microsoft.xrm.tooling.connector.crmserviceclient.bypasspluginexecution) when creating a new account record:

```csharp
var svc = new CrmServiceClient(conn);

svc.BypassPluginExecution = true;

var account = new Entity("account")
{
    Attributes = {
        { "name", "Test Account" }
    }
};

svc.Create(account);
```
Because this setting is applied to the service, it will remain set for all requests sent using the service until it is set to false.

#### You can set the value as an optional parameter with one of the Request classes

The following example sets the optional `BypassCustomPluginExecution` parameter when creating a new account record:

```csharp
var svc = new CrmServiceClient(conn);

var account = new Entity("account")
{
    Attributes = {
        { "name", "Test Account" }
    }
};

var createRequest = new CreateRequest
{
    Target = account
};
createRequest.Parameters.Add("BypassCustomPluginExecution", true);

svc.Execute(createRequest);
```
This optional parameter must be applied to each request individually. You cannot use this with the 7 other IOrganizationService Methods, such as Create, Update, Delete. You can only use the [Execute method](/dotnet/api/microsoft.xrm.sdk.iorganizationservice.execute) using one of the classes that are derived from the [OrganizationRequest Class](/dotnet/api/microsoft.xrm.sdk.organizationrequest).

You can use this method for data operations you initiate in your plug-ins.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

### Does this bypass plug-ins for data operations by Microsoft plug-ins?

No. If a plug-in or workflow in a Microsoft solution performs operations on other records, the logic for those operations are not bypassed. Only those plugins or workflows that apply to the specific operation will be bypassed.

### Can I use this option for data operations I perform within a plug-in?

Yes, But only when the plug-in is running in the context of a user who has the `prvByPassPlugins` privilege. For the Organization Service, set the optional `BypassCustomPluginExecution` parameter on the class derived from [OrganizationRequest Class](/dotnet/api/microsoft.xrm.sdk.organizationrequest). You cannot use the CrmServiceClient in a plug-in.
