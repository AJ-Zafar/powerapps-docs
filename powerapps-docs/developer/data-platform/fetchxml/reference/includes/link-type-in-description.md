Restricts results to rows with matching values in both tables using an [IN](/sql/t-sql/language-elements/in-transact-sql) condition in the `where` clause following this pattern:<br/>`parentEntity.LinkTo in (select linkEntity.LinkFrom from linkEntity <additional filters>)`.<br/>When using this link type, you can't select column values from the link entity and the parent row is only returned once when multiple matching link entity rows exist. This is equivalent to the `inner` type except it only returns the parent row at most once and doesn't return the column values of the link entity rows.
