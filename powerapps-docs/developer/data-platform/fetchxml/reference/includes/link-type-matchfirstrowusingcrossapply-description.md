Includes results from the parent element that don't have a matching value. When multiple matching link entity rows exist for a given parent row, the parent row is only returned once and the column values are included for only one of the matching link entity rows. This is useful when an example of a link entity row is needed but finding the column values for all of them is not required. This is equivalent to the `outer` type except it only finds at most one link entity row.
