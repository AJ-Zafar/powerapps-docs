 # Edit multiple rows
 
 [!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]
 
You can edit multiple rows in model-driven apps and quickly update several columns of data accross multiple rows in a single action. This is useful in scenarios when you need to update the same column for multiple rows for example when you need to change a website or phone number for multiple accounts rows.

When you edit multiple rows you can also select the form that that you want to edit. Columns such as timeline wall, quick view forms, reference panel, and etc. which you can edit indivdually aren't available when you're editing multple rows.

To open the bulk edit dialog, go to view page with the list of rows that you want to change. Select two or more rows and then on the command bar, select **Edit**.
