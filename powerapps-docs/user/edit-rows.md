 # Edit multiple rows
 
 [!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]
 
Editing more than one record in model-driven apps can help you update several columns of data in a table in a single action.  This is useful when you may need to update contact records with new accounts or change a website or email address for multiple accounts from the same company.
Editing multiple records, or bulk editing, has been updated to incorporate table forms that you are familiar with and use every day.  This includes the ability to change the form you want to use when editing multiple records to help facilitate a quicker and easier process by using the form or forms you use in your daily tasks.  Bulk editing is available from the view pages for a table.  
To open the bulk edit dialog, simply navigate or open the view page with the list of records you want to change. Click on two or more records in the view page and click on the Edit option in the command bar of the page.
The below example demonstrates how to use bulk edit when working with the Case table in a model-driven app and can be applied to any table in your application where you need to edit or manage data for more than one record.
After clicking on edit a dialog will open with the default form for the table.
