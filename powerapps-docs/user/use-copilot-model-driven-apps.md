# Use Copilot in model-driven apps (preview)

[This article is prerelease documentation and is subject to change.]

Copilot for model-driven apps in Power Apps is a next-generation AI assistant for you to get insights about the data in your apps through conversation in natural language. Copilot helps you boost your productivity through AI-powered insights and navigation assistance.

> - An administrator must enable Copilot in your application for you to see it in your app. More information: {Add copilot for app users in model-driven apps](../maker/model-driven-apps/add-ai-copilot.md)

## Copilot pane 

When enabled, Copilot can be accessed through the Copilot icon in the right navigation bar or through the Copilot icon in the top bar in a model-driven app. The copilot pane can be expanded or collapsed as desired. When enabled, the pane is expanded by default.

## Use Copilot to ask questions 

Copilot in model-driven apps can answer questions about the Microsoft Dataverse table data in the app. Copilot can also help you navigate the model-driven app. For example, when a user enters Navigate me to Online Cases, the copilot in the model-driven app automatically opens the relevant page in the app.

## Copilot suggested questions 

Copilot can suggest questions for you to ask to help you get started. These questions (also called prompts) can be edited and personalized for your app and the type of insight you need from Copilot. 

You see more suggested prompts by selecting View prompts within the Copilot pane. Many of the suggested questions have placeholders that you need to replace with an appropriate text that completes the question.
