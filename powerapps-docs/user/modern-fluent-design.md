# Modern, refreshed look for model-driven apps (preview)

[This topic is pre-release documentation and is subject to change.]

Model-driven apps have a modern, refreshed look when the **Try the new look and feel (preview)** feature has been turned on by makers of the apps.  This new look provides updated styling including fonts, colors, borders, shadows, and more that align to the latest [Microsoft Fluent design system](https://react.fluentui.dev/?path=/docs/concepts-introduction--page). The updated look makes model-driven apps easy-to-use so that users can accomplish their goals quickly and efficiently.

The Fluent design system provides consistency, quality, and Microsoft-wide platform coherence. It also provides a solid foundation for extensibility and allows support for dark mode in the future. 

## Whatâ€™s included with the new look

After the **Try the new look and feel (preview)** feature has been enabled for a model-driven app, you will see the new, modern interface in the app. Forms and view pages have updated styling for colors, fonts, elevation, rounded corners, and more. The Power Apps grid replaces the read-only grid. New Fluent-based field controls are used in many forms.

The updated visuals make use of several new patterns across the app and page types. Drop shadows and brighter background colors are used to create elevation, which aids in the separation of sections and focuses attention on the primary content. The floating command bar style aligns with the Microsoft 365 commanding experience and has consistent spacing, rounded corners, and elevation. For example, notice the new look of the command bar in the following image.

As a comparison, the command bar was not in a seperate section in previous versions of the user interface, as shown in the following image.

With the new look, Power Apps and Dynamics 365 apps are moving away from the classic theme customizations and will introduce a new theming capability in the future that builds on the Fluent design system.  

## Enable the new look
Makers can enable the new look for existing and new model-driven apps in the app designer by turning on the **Try the new look and feel (preview)** feature for each model-driven app. Model-driven apps that are part of the preview, will automatically get incremental enhancements on a weekly basis. For more information, see [Manage model-driven app settings in the app designer](../maker/model-driven-apps/app-properties.md#features).

## Provide feedback on the new look
After enabling the **Try the new look and feel (preview)** feature and using your model-driven apps, you can provide feedback on the new look on the [Power Apps Custom Page Feedback discussion thread](https://powerusers.microsoft.com/t5/Building-Power-Apps/Power-Apps-Custom-Page-Feedback-discussion-thread/m-p/1203993#M315697) web page.
