# Use Form filling assistance in model-driven apps (preview)

[This article is prerelease documentation and is subject to change.]


When using main forms in a Dynamics 365 or Power Apps model-driven app on the web with "New Look" enabled, users can review field suggestions generated by AI based on their frequently used data. These suggestions are optional, and users can choose to accept them, or ignore and reject them. Form fill assistance is available in English only.
