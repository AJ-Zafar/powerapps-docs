# Request a Power Apps license

End users can request a Power Apps license from their admin directly in the product. This feature is for new users and users who are already in an active Power Apps trial.

## Request a license
If you do not have a license and are trying to open a Power Apps app, you will see the options in the following image. Select **Request license** to submit a license request to your admin.

> [!NOTE]
> The options in the following image may differ depending on whether you've exhausted any Power Apps trials.

## Wait for response
After you request a license, you will see a banner at the top of the page that confirms that your request was sent, and that it might take a few days for your admin to respond to the request.

If you are using a Power Apps trial, you can continue to use the trial while you wait for your request to be approved.

After your admin has reviewed your request, you will receive an email notification indicating whether the request was approved or denied.
