# Request a Power Apps license

## Request a license

## Request a license through a trial
If you are already in an active Power Apps trial, you can request a license by selecting **Request license** at the top of the page.

## Wait for response
After you request a license, you will see a banner at the top of the page that confirms that your request was sent, and that it might take a few days for your admin to respond to the request.

If you are using a Power Apps trial, you can continue to use the trial while you wait for your request to be approved.

After your admin has reviewed your request, you will receive an email notification indicating whether the request was approved or denied.
