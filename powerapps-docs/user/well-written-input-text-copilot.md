# Enter well-written, input text in Power Apps using Copilot (preview)

[This article is prerelease documentation and is subject to change.]

End users can use Copilot to quickly generate well-written text that can be used as input text in text boxes in apps made with Power Apps. This saves time for end users as they won’t have to worry about creating well-written text themselves that meets grammar rules. This is especially helpful for end users who are using apps that aren’t in their native language.

## How this feature works

When a user is trying to quickly input text into text boxes in an app, the user might worry about forming complete sentences and having grammatically-correct text. With the assistance of Copilot, a user can quickly jot down their ideas in a text box without worrying about format and grammar. Copilot corrects grammar errors and eloquently refines the user's ideas. The user can also change the tone and length of the output to fit their scenario.
