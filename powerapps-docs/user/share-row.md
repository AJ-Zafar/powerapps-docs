 ## Share a row with someone else
 
 [!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]
 
 If you want to keep ownership of a row but let someone else work on the row with you then use the share option.
 
Any user that you want to share a row with needs to have basic level access that is granted by a system administrator. If you cannot select an option when you share a row the you need to check with your system administrator to see if that user or team can be granted basic access based on your organizations roles and access defined by your administrator.

> This feature is not supported on Power Apps mobile or when you're using the app in offline mode with no internet connection. 


## Share rows

1. You can share a row from a view page or when you open a row.

    - **Share from the view page**: Select one or more rows on a view page and then select **Share** on the command bar.

      > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]

    - **Open a row and share**: Open a row and then select **Share** on the command bar. If you don't see the share option, then select the **More commands** ellipsis and then select **Share**.

      > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
