# Collaborate with others in model-driven apps (preview)

[This topic is pre-release documentation and is subject to change.]

Model-driven apps in Power Apps helps you connect with the right people quickly by showing you who’s available and who’s currently working on a row. Collaborate and share the way as you do in other Microsoft Office apps.


## Multiplayer apps 

When you're working on a row such as an **Opportunity**, **Account**, **Contact** or **Case** you can also see other users that are working on the same row. Select a user's picture to see their online status, send an email, or start a Teams chat.


  > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
  > ![](media/collob-1.png "")


This feature is only available in the **Opportunity**, **Account**, **Contact** and **Case** tables that are in customer engagement apps such as [Dynamics 365 Sales](/dynamics365/sales-professional/help-hub.md), [Dynamics 365 Customer Service](/dynamics365/customer-service/help-hub.md).

## Online availability and picture 

A user who owns a row, are displayed with their picture and online status.

This features works in to user lookups and grid user columns.

## Sharing 

Links to records can be shared easily via the “Share” button in the top right corner of the command bar: 


  > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
  > ![](media/collob-2.png "")


Copying the link allows you to easily paste it into any app. 

This feature will be expanded during the preview period to allow copy-pasted shared links to give read only access to the row to people who select on the link.
