# Collaborate with others in model-driven apps 

Collaborate with colleagues and share links in model-driven Power Apps the same way do you as in Microsoft Office.


### Multiplayer apps 

When you're working on a record form you can also see other users that are working on the same record.

You can also select a user's picture to see their online status, send them an email, or start a Teams chat.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![View a user's online status.](media/collob-1.png "View a user's online status")



### View a user's status and picture

App users, such as the record owner, as well as the users appearing in grids and lookups are displayed with their picture and online status.  This feature is now available on all model-driven apps and cannot be disabled.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![VView a user's online status.](media/collob-2.png "View a user's online status.")

> [!NOTE]
> This feature will be extended to user lookups and grid user columns. 


### Share 
You can now easily share records with your colleagues via the new share button.  Choose to "Copy link" or "Email link" in order to send a record link to your colleagues.

Note: If you have the share privilege on the record, when emailing a link to a colleague we will automatically give them read access to the record.
