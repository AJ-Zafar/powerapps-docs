# Collaborate with others in model-driven apps (preview)

[This topic is pre-release documentation and is subject to change.]

Efficient communication is the cornerstone of every successful business. Power Apps helps you connect with the right people quickly by showing you who’s available and who’s currently working on a row. Sharing is made simple by aligning the user interface to what Microsoft Office users are accustomed to. 
his feature is currently available only in Opportunity, Account, Contact and Case entities 

This feature is available in the **Opportunity**, **Account**, **Contact** and **Case** table that are in customer engagement apps such as [Dynamics 365 Sales](/dynamics365/sales-professional/help-hub.md), [Dynamics 365 Customer Service](/dynamics365/customer-service/help-hub.md).


## Multiplayer apps 

Co-presence lets you know who is currently looking at the record by showing their avatar in the top right corner of the command bar:


  > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
  > ![](media/collob-1.png "")

Clicking on the avatar will allow you to see that person’s on-line presence, as well as start an email or a chat with them. 



## On-line availability and picture 

App users, such as the record owner, are displayed with their picture and on-line status. 
This features works in to user lookups and grid user columns. 


  > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
  > ![](media/collob-2.png "")
  

## Sharing 

Links to records can be shared easily via the “Share” button in the top right corner of the command bar: 


  > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
  > ![](media/collob-2.png "")


Copying the link allows you to easily paste it into any app. 

This feature will be expanded during the preview period to allow copy-pasted shared links to give read only access to the record to people who click on the link.
