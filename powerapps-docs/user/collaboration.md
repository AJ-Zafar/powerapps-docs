# Collaborate with others in model-driven apps

Efficient communication is the cornerstone of every successful business.  Power Apps helps you connect with the right people quickly by showing you who’s available and who’s currently working on the record.  Sharing is made simple by aligning the UI to what Microsoft Office users are accustomed to. 

> [!NOTE]
> Before you can share rows using Access Team, your admin will need to set-up an Access Team template. For more information, see [About team templates](/previous-versions/dynamicscrm-2016/admins-customizers-dynamics-365/mt812239(v%3dcrm.8)). 

1. To give a user permission to access a row, from the site map, select the row type. For example, **Accounts**.
2. From the list of rows, open the row that you want to provide another user access to.

  > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
  > ![My active accounts.](media/AccessTeam1.png "My active accounts")
