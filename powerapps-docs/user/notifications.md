# Preview: In-app notifications in model-driven apps 

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

In-app notifications allow users to receive notifications in the notification center and optionally as a toast notification. Each notification is sent to a specific user and is only shown to the user when the web or mobile app is running. Notifications are stored until in the notification center until you dismiss them or when they expire. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - This is a preview feature, and isn't available in all regions. Your administrator needs to enable [early access](/power-platform/admin/opt-in-early-access-updates) to use the new app notifications feature.
> - [!INCLUDE[cc_preview_features_definition](../includes/cc-preview-features-definition.md)]

When you start using an app the system checks for new notifications and will displays any new notifications. Notifications are at the organization level which means you can see notifications regardless of the app your using.


## Notification center

- The notification bell icon shows the count of new notifications. When you open the notification center count is cleared. To access your notifications, select the bell icon on the nav bar. 


  > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
  > ![Sample notifications in your app.](media/notifications-bell.png)  


- To dismiss and delete a notification, select the close **X** button on a notification. Or, select **Dismiss all** to dismiss and delete all notifications. Your system administrator can set when notification expire by default they will expire in 14 days.

## Toast notifications

Toast notifications appear temporarily to the left edge of the application. When multiple notifications appear, they are stacked. When more than three toast notifications are received at a time, a toast indicates that there are more in notification center.

The notificationâ€™s sender or system administrator can indicate if toasts are enable for notification. If toasts are enabled, you can trun them off at a user level. Regardless of the toast being shown, all notifications can be accessed from notification center.

1. To enable or disable toast notifications in the notification center, select **Settings** 

 > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
