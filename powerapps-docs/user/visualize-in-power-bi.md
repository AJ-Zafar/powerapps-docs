# Visualize your data in a view quickly with Power BI service (preview)


[This topic is pre-release documentation and is subject to change.]

You can create reports quickly in the Power BI service starting with the data in a view in a model-driven app. Power BI automatically generates the visuals for you, so you can explore your data with just a few clicks.

New to creating in Power BI? Try reading [Reports in Power BI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/consumer/end-user-reports) for some quick background information.

If you use Power BI Desktop, you can also [create a report using data from Dataverse in Power BI Desktop](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/data-platform/data-platform-powerbi-connector).

*IMPORTANT: All the capabilities listed below are available on model-driven apps that have the setting **Enable Power BI quick report visualization on a table (Preview)** enabled.*

## Visualize in Power BI

In a model-driven app, on a table's homepage grid, select Visualize this view from the list of commands at the top of the page.

You can see a Power BI-generated visualization of the data in the view, based on the view definition. That is, the filters acting on the view are automatically applied to the Power BI visualization. A subset of columns that are part of the view are used to auto-generate the Power BI visuals

The full set of view columns are available in the Power BI report to be used to change the data you see in the report.

For more information on how you can interact with this visualization please see: Visualize your data quickly from Power Apps and Dynamics 365 apps (Preview) *&lt;Link to be provided by Amanda Rivera&gt;*

## Licensing considerations

Anyone can use the **Visualize this view** feature to explore the data in a view, but to enter the full edit experience, publish reports, access reports that others have published, or delete reports, you need a Power BI Pro license. If you don't currently have a Pro license, you can [buy a Power BI Pro license or start a free trial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/fundamentals/service-self-service-signup-purchase-for-power-bi).

## Known issues and limitations

-   The first time you visualize the data in a view, creating the dataset and report can take some time. We're working to improve the end-to-end performance of this experience.

-   Columns are indicated by their logical names rather than the display name. We're working on updating this experience, so the columns' display names are in the Power BI report.

-   This feature isn't supported for guest users in a tenant.
