# Conclusion

Fusion development is not a strict methodology; rather, it's an approach and philosophy that encourages rapid software development.

Fusion development combines the technical and business skills of an organization's employees to design and build applications. This approach values the insights and abilities of the different members of the team. It utilizes their specific insights into the business requirements and technical challenges required to implement a solution. The synergy afforded by fusion development enables efficient communication between different team members and enables them to iterate quickly to produce a functional system.

In this ebook, you've seen how the staff at VanArsdel followed a fusion development approach. They produced an app that meets the expectations of the users represented by Caleb, the technician, Maria, the inventory manager, and Malik, who schedules engineers. Preeti is also satisfied that the system is safe and maintainable. The project was completed in record time - from the initial discussions between Caleb and Maria, to the rollout to all technicians.

The VanArsdel team has now experienced how fusion development teams work and is excited to keep collaborating on future projects.
