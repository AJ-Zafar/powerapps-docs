# Overview.......TODO

Digital transformation as a mechanism for improving business efficiency is a key component in the success of most organizations today. Yet often, the business-focused domain experts are unable to create apps with the functionality that they want, whereas developers may struggle to understand the commercial and process implications of the code they’re asked to build. In consequence, there can be a disconnect between an organization’s business imperatives and the subsequent implementation of that company’s applications.
However, enabling organizations to truly support business growth takes more than just a top-notch development team; it requires the participation of business-savvy individuals to drive the creation of solutions that an organization can use to maintain its competitive advantage. Microsoft Power Apps – part of Microsoft Power Platform – enables these ‘makers’ (that is, business technologists or individuals with business domain experience) to build and deploy low-code or no-code applications within fusion teams. 
Fusion teams unite business technologists, professional developers, and IT departments into a joint venture that can deliver production-ready digital products. These blended teams can accelerate development cycles and release products more quickly that provide the solutions that users need today. 

## Aim

The aim of this document is to provide guidance for multidisciplinary teams to define and adopt co-development best practices that help promote collaboration, accelerate scalable development, reduce organizational silos, and optimize application delivery of low-code applications when using Microsoft Power Apps.
