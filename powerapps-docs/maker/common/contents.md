When you enable your own welcome content, it will replace the default Power Apps first-time help experience.

Note, this feature only works with Managed Environments. More information: [Managed Environments overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/managed-environment-overview)

# First-time experience for makers

Once the maker welcome content is enabled, when a maker signs in Power Apps with a managed environment, they will see the customized getting started information.

If you select **Don't show this again here,** you can still access the getting starting information from the **Learn** hub.

-   Select **Learn** on the left pane and then select, **From your org**.

Any updates to the Maker Onboarding content will reset the modal, and users will again see it pop up in the maker portal. It may take up to an hour for the content to refresh.
