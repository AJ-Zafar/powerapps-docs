# Request Power Apps licenses for your app users

As a Power Apps maker, you can request a Power Apps license for users of your app. Select **Request licenses** to submit a license request to your admin when sharing a [canvas app](../canvas-apps/share-app.md) or [model-driven app](../model-driven-apps/share-model-driven-app.md) with other users.

> [!Note]
> You can't request licenses for security groups or distribution lists.

After your admin has reviewed your request, you'll receive an email notification indicating whether the request was approved or denied.
