# AI plugins in Power Platform

The Power Platform plugin builder enables Makers to view AI plugins available in their environment or guide them to creating new ones. 

The AI plugins leverage Power Platform components like flows, connectors or prompts to define a specific business behavior which can be added to a Copilot. The Copilot will use the appropriate plugin able to address the questions of an end user in the application.

With AI plugins, makers can build capabilities enabling Copilot to answer questions they wouldnâ€™t be able to tackle by default or to enhance out-of-the-box answers.

Use [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/) to create AI plugins. You can also go to [MCS/PVA content link here](tbd) to create AI plugins for use across Power Platform.



> [!NOTE]
> This article introduces you to the AI plugin experience available in Power Apps interface. The experience creating AI plugins in Power Apps is same in MCS/PVA. For detailed step-by-step instructions creating AI plugins using Power Apps or MCS/PVA interface, see [MCS/PVA content link here](tbd) Types of AI plugins.

You can create the following different types of AI plugins using Power Apps experience.


|ColumPlugin type  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Prompts plugins     | Prompts allow generating content using natural language which includes summarizing, classifying, extracting entities, translating, assessing sentiment and much more. [Learn more](AIB prompts doc page)   |
|Custom connector plugins     | Custom connectors allow retrieving and updating data from external sources accessed through APIs. [Lean more](/connectors/custom-connectors)  |
|Open AI plugins       | Open AI plugins provide access to data sources, allowing specific data to be surfaced through AI experiences that would not normally be available through general models. [Learn more](https://platform.openai.com/docs/plugins/introduction) |
|Power Automate flow plugins     | Power Automate flows allow defining custom automations. These kinds of plugins are appropriate when a Maker wants to perform several actions which are not only about accessing data or generating content. [Learn more](/power-automate) |
