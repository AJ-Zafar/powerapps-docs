They also provide a more cohesive experince and top-notch design for end-users. Modern controls are designed with a focus on accessibility, usability, and performance which makes them visually appealing, highly functional, and intuitive to use.

## What's next for these controls?
We will be consistently shipping improvements and new capabilities for modern controls with up to date documentation. You can keep track of coming changes through this blog (link).
  
## Provide feedback to Microsoft
Your feedback will help us improve the new controls and make Power Apps even better. We are constantly listening to feedback from our users and working to improve the platform in meaningful ways.

You can provide feedback even to individual controls within Power Apps studio while building apps. You will view thumbs up/down and comments option in properties of new controls. Once you provide feedback, our teams will consider those for next set of improvements. 

You can also provide feedback and reach out to us via the community forum (add link) where we will also eagerly answer all your queries.
