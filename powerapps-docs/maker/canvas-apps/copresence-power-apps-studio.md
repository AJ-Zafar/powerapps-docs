# Find out who's working on the same app

Use copresence to identify individuals working on the same app as you in Power Apps Studio. Copresence offers the following advantages:

- The command bar displays the names and icons of other makers who are working on the app and may be making changes. 
- The left-hand navigation pane in Power Apps Studio displays the app's structure, indicating which part of the app is being worked on. 
- You'll receive a notification to refresh the app when the maker that's editing the app makes changes and saves that app.

## How copresence works

The first time someone opens your app in Power Apps Studio while you're working on it, copresence indicators appear that shows other people are also working on the app. 

The maker that opens the app first has editing control. If a second user tries to open the app, a notification appears letting them know that someone else is editing the app so they're in read-only mode. If you're in ready-only mode, you can save a copy of the app.

Icons of copresent makers appear in both the command bar and the left navigation pane showing where other makers are working in the app.

You may be working on the app, or you may be idle, but once someone else saves a change to the app, you receive a notification letting you know that another maker made changes. When this happens, you're advised to refresh the app to get latest version.
