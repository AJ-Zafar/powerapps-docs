# Get started with Power Apps (preview)

[This article is prerelease documentation and is subject to change.]

The [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc) home page offers you various options for creating your own apps, opening apps that you or others have created, and performing related tasks. These tasks range from the most simple, such as identifying the license or licenses that give you access, to more advanced capabilities like creating custom connections to specific data sources.

You can select options in these general areas:

1. [Left navigation pane](#1--left-navigation-pane)
2. [Search bar at the top](#2--search-bar)
3. [Header on the top right of the page](#3--header-on-the-top-right-on-the-page)
4. [Large icons that feature prominently in the middle of the page]()
5. [Get help from a virtual agent])(#5--ask-a-virtual-agent)

- **Create**: This is where you create apps as such as [canvas apps](/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/), [model-driven apps](/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/), [chatbots](/powerapps/chatbots), and [AI models](/powerapps/use-ai-builder).
- **Learn**: The [learn hub](../common/learn-hub.md) lets you explore documents, training material, get help from the Power Apps community, and other resources that will help you to create and build Power Apps.
- **Apps**: If you've created an app (or someone else has created one and shared it with you), you can play or edit it. You can also filter the list of apps based on criteria such as whether you opened it recently.
- **More**: Pin your most-used items to the left navigation such as tables, flows, and more.
- **Power Platform**: Links to the Power Platform admin center.
