# Improved tab stops for the keyboard tab key in canvas apps (Experimental)

[This article is pre-release documentation and is subject to change.]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - This is an experimental feature.
> - [!INCLUDE[cc_preview_features_definition](../../includes/cc-preview-features-definition.md)]

When you're nesting controls such as containers and component instances, the user input value for [TabIndex](controls/properties-accessibility.md#tabindex) isn't respected sometimes. **Improved tab stops** experimental setting improves the keyboard tab stop behavior when using composite or nested controls in canvas apps during these instances.

This feature also adds support for handling accessibility for keyboard tabs inline with rest of the controls in canvas apps. And addresses manual TabIndex assignments for all controls and components.

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is added as "Experimental" to maintain backward compatibility and maintain existing app functionality.

When this feature is turned on, it also enables the following boolean properties for containers and component in canvas apps:

| Property Name | Description |
| - | - |
| **Prioritize child controls** | Determines the order of navigation (**Z-order**) on canvas when pressing tab key on the keyboard. <ul> <li> **True** (Default): Pressing the tab key on the keyboard will first progress through all child controls of the current container before moving to the next available control. This option is recommended for similarly nested HTML elements. </li> <li> **False**: Pressing the tab key on the keyboard will progress through all controls only based on Z-order, ignoring parent-child relationship between controls or containers. </li> </ul> **Note**: This property isn't applicable to [responsive or autolayout](create-responsive-layout.md) containers. |
| **Focus on child controls** | Determines the value of [TabIndex](controls/properties-accessibility.md#tabindex) for child controls. <ul> <li> **True** (Default): Pressing the tab key behaves as per TabIndex values defined on each control. </li> <li> **False**: Pressing the tab key doesn't move focus to any child control for the selected container or component. This option sets the TabIndex value to **-1** for all child controls of the current container or component. |

## Configure improved tab stops in your app

Follow these steps to enable this feature in your app, and set the properties mentioned earlier.

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.poweraps.com).

1. Select **Apps** from the left-pane.

1. Select your app, and then select **Edit**.

1. In Power Apps Studio, select **File** > **Settings** > **Upcoming features** > **Experimental**.

1. Select **Improved tab stops** to turn on the feature. !![Screenshot to follow]!!

1. Close settings.

Now that you've enabled the experimental feature, you'll see two new properties for controls and containers&mdash;**Prioritize child controls**, and **Focus on child controls**. Change the property values as appropriate.

## Examples

Now that you understand the new feature with improved tab stops, let's take a look at a few examples to understand the behavior when the tab key is pressed.

### Default behavior

The following example shows multiple Text input controls, and several nesting scenarios. The number displayed in the input represents the value of the [TabIndex](controls/properties-accessibility.md#tabindex) property. There are two nested containers, and component controls overlaid on top of each other.

The default order is determined by the relative position of the controls. When focus enters a container or a component, tabs first traverse the children of the container before moving on to the next available control.

### Prioritize child controls set to False

In the following example, every container and component have the **Prioritize child controls** property set to "False". All inputs are therefore considered to be on the same level of nesting, so the order is determined purely by their [X/Y position](controls/properties-size-location.md#position) relative to the screen.

### Hybrid settings

In the following example, the orange outlined containers have **Prioritize child controls** property set to "False". All others controls have this property set to "True". Also, a custom [TabIndex](controls/properties-accessibility.md#tabindex) property has been set for some inputs, indicated by the number shown in each input.

Tab order first proceeds through the containers and controls with TabIndex value of greater than 0, and then proceeds through all others with value of 0. This behavior was also the in the earlier implementation.
