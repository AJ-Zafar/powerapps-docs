# Build mobile apps with address input and map components

There are many scenarios where users are expected to enter addresses in an app. Historically, there have been multiple fields capturing each element of an address where the user types in the street address, city and the postal code and can select state. Entering addresses can be frustrating and error-prone, particularly in mobile scenarios.

The address input component presents the user with dynamic address suggestions as they type. Using fuzzy matching logic, the component suggests multiple potential address matches from which the user can select—making it quicker and easier to enter accurate addresses.

The component returns the address as structured data, allowing the application to extract information like city, street, municipality, and even latitude and longitude. The data is in a format friendly to many locales and international address formats.

To use the component, you need to enable geospatial features for the environment.

In this topic we will learn how to use the address input component in our canvas app.

## Prerequisites

To complete this lesson, you will need a Power Apps environment with a Dataverse database. If you do not have a license, you can sign up for the [Power Apps Developer Plan](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/communityplan/) or use a Power Apps trial.

## Create a trial environment

An environment in Power Apps is a space to store, manage, and share your organization’s business data, apps, chatbots, and flows. It also serves as a container to separate apps that might have different roles, security requirements, or target audiences.

Each environment can have one Dataverse database.

To make sure that you have what you need to complete this lesson, we are going to create a new environment that includes a Dataverse database. This is a 30-day trial that will go away at the end of the 30 days, but it can be upgraded to a sandbox or production environment if you want to keep it

We are going to create a trial environment that will include a Dataverse database, and the sample data used in this topic.

1.  Go to <https://aka.ms/ppac> in a web browser

2.  Select **Environments**

3.  Click **New**

4.  Name the environment **Dataverse Trial**

5.  Select **Trial** for environment type

6.  Toggle **Create Database** to **Yes**

7.  Click **Next**

    ![Create a trial environment](media/mobile-apps-address-map/create-a-trial-environment-1.png)

8.  Toggle **Deploy Sample Apps and Data** to **Yes**

9.  Click **Save**

Your trial environment will now be created, including a Dataverse database and
sample data in common business data tables.

## Enable the geospatial features for the environment

Before we can use geospatial features in our apps, an admin must enable access to the features for the environment where we want to create our app.

The geospatial features require additional terms of use that must be reviewed and agreed to.

1.  Open the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/)

2.  On the **Environments** tab, select the environment you want to use for your
    apps, and then select **Settings** from the top menu

![Enable the geospatial features](media/mobile-apps-address-map/enable-the-geospatial-features-for-the-environment-1.png)

![Select settings](media/mobile-apps-address-map/enable-the-geospatial-features-for-the-environment-2.png)

3.  Expand **Product**, and then select **Features**

![Select features](media/mobile-apps-address-map/enable-the-geospatial-features-for-the-environment-3.png)

4.  Under **Geospatial services,** set the toggle switch to **On** – a terms of
    service notice will appear – Read through the terms of service, and if you
    agree, select the checkbox **I agree to the terms of service**, and then
    select **Enable**

![Toggle Geospatial services off](media/mobile-apps-address-map/enable-the-geospatial-features-for-the-environment-4.png)

![Accept the TOS](media/mobile-apps-address-map/enable-the-geospatial-features-for-the-environment-5.png)

Thus, the geospatial services are enabled for the environment

## Build a canvas app

In this lesson we will start with creating an app and then create a Header Component to use within the app to standardize the look and feel of the header on different screens

1.  Log in to <https://make.powerapps.com>

2.  Select the Dataverse Trial environment in the upper right corner

    ![Select your environment](media/mobile-apps-address-map/build-a-canvas-app-1.png)

### Features

In this section we will go over various properties of the address component and
set them – there are a few Address Input specific properties as highlighted
below

![Address input components](media/mobile-apps-address-map/address-input-component-3.png)

| **Property**         | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Search result limit  | The number of suggested addresses the component displays – we set it to 5 in our example, so not more than 5 addresses will show up in our search                                                                              |
| Search within radius | Whether the component should suggest addresses within the user-defined **Radius** of the **Latitude** and **Longitude –** we set it to Yes in our example                                                                      |
| Latitude             | The latitude of the center point used to geo-bias address suggestions. Requires **Search within radius** to be on – we set it to the formula Location.Latitude in our example to return the latitude of the current location   |
| Longitude            | The longitude of the center point used to geo-bias address suggestions. Requires **Search within radius** to be on – we set it to the formula Location.Longitude in our example to return the latitude of the current location |
| Radius               | The radius, in meters, around **Latitude** and **Longitude** to constrain the address suggestions. Requires **Search within radius** to be on – we set that to 100000 in our example                                           |
| Language             | The language the address suggestions are returned in – we left it as the defaulted English (United States) option                                                                                                              |
| Country set          | Comma-separated list of countries to constrain the address suggestions to, in ISO 3166 alpha-2 country codes. For example, **US, FR, KW – we set it as US in our example**                                                     |

### Output properties

The component outputs various properties when a user interacts with it inside an app. You can use these outputs in other components or to customize the experience.

The following table lists the output properties available.

| Municipality                | Municipality.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| MunicipalitySubdivision     | Municipality subdivision.                                                                                                                                                               |
| CountryTertiarySubdivision  | Country tertiary subdivision.                                                                                                                                                           |
| CountrySecondarySubdivision | Country secondary subdivision.                                                                                                                                                          |
| CountrySubdivision          | Country subdivision.                                                                                                                                                                    |

Now, when we run the app and start typing an address, it will show addresses that match the entered value and are located only within 100000 meters of the current location. Also, notice that it does not show more than 5 address suggestions at a time when you start typing in the address.

![Address entry](media/mobile-apps-address-map/address-input-component-4.gif)

Using the above component, we will capture the address in the address fields of our form to create a new account – this is useful so that the user does not have to type in each of the address elements individually.

We will set the Datacard values to the appropriate property value from the address input.

NOTE: The default values of the datacards could be locked. To unlock them, select the data card and go to the Advanced properties and select **Unlock to change properties**

![Unlock the control](media/mobile-apps-address-map/address-input-component-5.png)

1.  Set the Address 1: Street 1 Datacard Default to AddressInput1.StreetNumber &
    " " & AddressInput1.StreetName

![Address formula](media/mobile-apps-address-map/address-input-component-6.png)

2.  Set the Address 1: City Datacard Default to AddressInput1.Municipality

3.  Set the Address 1: State/Province address property Default to
    AddressInput1.CountrySubdivision

4.  Set the Address 1: Zip/Postal Code Datacard Default to
    AddressInput1.PostalCode

5.  Set the Address 1: Country/Region Datacard Default to AddressInput1.Country

6.  Set the Address 1: Latitude Datacard Default to
    AddressInput1.SelectedLatitude

7.  Set the Address 1: Longitude Datacard Default to
    AddressInput1.SelectedLongitude

8.  Thus, the form gets populated with all the address fields when an address is
    selected in the Address Input component

![Final form](media/mobile-apps-address-map/address-input-component-7.png)

## Map component

In this section we will see how we can add the Map component to our app to show the selected location on the map

1.  Before adding the Map component, we need to create a collection to capture the address from the Address Input – this collection will be used as the data source for the Map
    
2.  On the OnAddressSelect property of the Address Input, enter the following formula to create a collection that captures the address data

```   
ClearCollect(
    colSelectedAddress,
    {
        Street: AddressInput1.StreetNumber & " " & AddressInput1.StreetName,
        City: AddressInput1.Municipality,
        State: AddressInput1.CountrySubdivision,
        Zip: AddressInput1.PostalCode,
        Country: AddressInput1.Country,
        Latitude: AddressInput1.SelectedLatitude,
        Longitude: AddressInput1.SelectedLongitude
    }
)
```

![Map component formula](media/mobile-apps-address-map/map-component-1.png)

3.  Now, click outside of the address input and select **Insert** -\> **Media** -\> **Map** to add the map component to the screen

![Select map](media/mobile-apps-address-map/map-component-2.png)

4.  Select the collection as the data source

![Select the component](media/mobile-apps-address-map/map-component-3.png)

5.  Place the Map below the Address input as shown below

### Features

In this section we will go over the various properties of the map component and set them

Below is a list of all the input and output properties available for the Map component:

| **Property**                            | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

### Output properties

The component outputs various properties when a user interacts with it inside an app. You can use these outputs in other components or to customize the experience.

The following table lists the output properties available.

| **Property**         | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                               |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CenterLocation       | Center location of the map as either .Latitude or .Longitude. The output will be an integer. For example, calling Map1.CenterLocation.Latitude will output a single integer such as 47.60357. |
| Selected             | The selected pin on the map.                                                                                                                                                                  |

| GeoJSON              | The list of shapes on the map in Feature Collection GeoJSON format.                                                                                                                           |

To drop a Pin on the address entered in our address input, we will use the collection we created on the OnAddressSelect property and use that in the map control

| Property       | Value                        |
|----------------|------------------------------|
| Items          | colSelectedAddress           |
| ItemsLatitudes | colSelectedAddress.Latitude  |
| ItemsLongitude | colSelectedAddress.Longitude |

Some of the properties of the pin can be customized per location pin are as follows:

1.  **ItemsColors**: To update the color of the pin to a different color for
    each location – add a column to the collection Color: Red and use that in
    the **ItemsColors** DATA property of the Map control

2.  **ItemsLabels**: To update the label of the pin to a different label showing
    the address for each location – add a column to the collection Label:
    AddressInput1.FreeformAddress and use that in the **ItemsLabels** DATA
    property of the Map control

3.  **ItemsIcons**: To update the Icon of the pin to a different icon for each
    location – add a column to the collection and use that in the **ItemsIcons**
    DATA property of the Map control – for our example lets add a triangle icon
    thus the formula will be Icon: triangle

    NOTE: For a list of icons, please refer the following link:

    https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/how-to-use-image-templates-web-sdk\#list-of-image-templates

```
ClearCollect(
    colSelectedAddress,
    {
        Street: AddressInput1.StreetNumber & " " & AddressInput1.StreetName,
        City: AddressInput1.Municipality,
        State: AddressInput1.CountrySubdivision,
        Zip: AddressInput1.PostalCode,
        Country: AddressInput1.Country,
        Latitude: AddressInput1.SelectedLatitude,
        Longitude: AddressInput1.SelectedLongitude,
        Label: AddressInput1.FreeformAddress,
        Color: Red,
        Icon: Triangle
    }
);
```

After adding these to the collection, go to the Advanced tab of the Map component and update the ItemsColors, ItemsLabels and ItemsIcons properties as shown below

![Map component advanced properties](media/mobile-apps-address-map/map-component-6.png)

Run the app in preview mode to test it – the map shows the location selected in the address input with a triangle icon and the address shows up as a label on the map
