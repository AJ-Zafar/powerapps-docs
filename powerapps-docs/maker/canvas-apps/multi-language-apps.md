>> [!IMPORTANT] This approach uses a feature of canvas apps that is still in public preview. For more information, see [Create a component for canvas apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/create-component)

Build a multi-language canvas app by leveraging canvas app components and translations based on a language selected by the user or based on the user's localized language.
