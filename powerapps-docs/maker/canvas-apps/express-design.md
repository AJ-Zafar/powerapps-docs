# Express design (preview)

[This article is pre-release documentation and is subject to change.]

Express design is a new way to quickly get started with Power Apps by instantly transforming your visual design into an app. With **Express design**, makers can quickly turn existing design artifacts&mdash;including paper forms, whiteboard sketches, or Figma files, into a working app.

If you have a design but are struggling with the nitty gritty UI adjustments and data set up work  for your app, then try out Express design. Power Apps will do the heavy lifting for you by identifying the UI elements from your design and convert that into Power Apps controls.

You can add data connection either during the app creation steps, or after the app is generated and connect to your business data from a wide variety of Microsoft and third-party data sources. After your new canvas app is generated in Power Apps Studio, you can continue to build and edit it.

## Get started with Express design

Express design currently supports design artifacts in the form of an image or a Figma design file.

### Image to app

If you have some rough ideas that you put on paper, a presentation or some legacy apps/tools that you want to modernize, try **Image to app** by taking a picture or a screenshot of your design, and follow the steps in the [Create an app from an image](app-from-image.md) article to create your app.Data setup is available in the wizard, but optional.

### Figma to app

If you’re a designer or you're working with them, you can try **Figma to app** by using the [Create Apps from Figma UI Kit](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2193981) to first design your app in Figma, then upload the Figma URL to Power Apps to convert it into a pixel-perfect app. For more information, see [Create an app from Figma](figma/overview.md). After generating the app, yYou can then connect your app to your business data.
