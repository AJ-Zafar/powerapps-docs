# Example: Create a flow and trigger it from a Power App

Power Automate can be used to create logic that performs one or more tasks when an event occurs in a canvas app. For example, a button can be configured so that, when a user selects it, an item is created in a SharePoint list, an email or meeting request is sent, a file is added to the cloud, or all of these. Any control in the app can be configured to start the flow, which continues to run even if you close Power Apps.

In this topic we will learn how to use create and trigger a flow using canvas apps.

## Prerequisites

To complete this lesson, you will need a Flow and Power Apps environment with a Dataverse database. If you do not have a license, you can sign up for the [Power Apps Developer Plan](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/communityplan/) or use a Power Apps trial.

## Create a trial environment

An environment in Power Apps is a space to store, manage, and share your organization’s business data, apps, chatbots, and flows. It also serves as a container to separate apps that might have different roles, security requirements, or target audiences.

Each environment can have one Dataverse database.

To make sure that you have what you need to complete this lesson, we are going to create a new environment that includes a Dataverse database. This is a 30-day trial that will go away at the end of the 30 days, but it can be upgraded to a sandbox or production environment if you want to keep it

We are going to create a trial environment that will include a Dataverse database, and the sample data used in this topic.

1.  Go to <https://aka.ms/ppac> in a web browser

2.  Select **Environments**

3.  Select **New**

4.  Name the environment **Dataverse Trial**

5.  Select **Trial** for environment type

6.  Toggle **Create Database** to **Yes**

7.  Select **Next**

8.  Toggle **Deploy Sample Apps and Data** to **Yes**

9.  Select **Save**

Your trial environment will now be created, including a Dataverse database and sample data in common business data tables.

## Test the app

1.  Run the app in Preview mode – In this test, we will create a new account by entering details like account name, phone number, city, and email address on the New Account page. On saving the new account details, we will be prompted to send an email to the customer where we can update the verbiage of the email and then select Yes to send the email. This will trigger the flow and email will be sent to the email address on the account.
