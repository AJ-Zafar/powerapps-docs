# Power Apps Ideas (Preview)

[This article is pre-release documentation and is subject to change.]

[Power Fx](/power-platform/power-fx/overview) is a powerful, low-code language to help makers stitch app components together. However, sometimes it's not easy to write a formula. It takes time to learn and effort to tune. Power Apps Ideas is created to help customers ease the formula authoring experience by using the power of AI models. 
You can use Ideas in two ways
1. Type in your requirement in plain English.
2. Give one or a few desired outputs so Power Apps will help you generate formulas to do the manipulation.

The natural langauge to formula feature can only work on Gallery and Data table's Items property. The example to formula feature can only work on a label control within a gallery. Please refer to following links to see details.
