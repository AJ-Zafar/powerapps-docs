# Power Apps Ideas (Preview)

[Power Fx](/power-platform/power-fx/overview) is the open-source programming language for low code, and makes it possible for hundreds of millions of people with Excel skills to add advanced logic to their apps. However, sometimes it's not easy to write a formula, even for the most experienced Power Fx users, as it may sometimes take a lot of time searching for, learning about, and debugging complex formulas. Power Apps Ideas is created to help everyone from the new makers to the seasoned IT pros to ease and expedite the formula authoring experience by using the power of AI models.

If you’re also struggling with Power Fx and you don’t actually want to spend that much time on it, try out Power Apps Ideas.

## Use Power Apps Ideas in your app

To use Power Apps Ideas, you'll find an Ideas pane on the right side of your canvas app, next to **Properties** and **Advanced** tabs.

There are two methods to benefit from Power Apps Ideas in your app.

### Method 1: Transform natural language to Power Fx formulas

You can enter your requirements in plain natural language (currently limited to English (en-us)), and Power Apps transforms your requirement to Power Fx formula. 

For details, go to [Transform natural language to Power Fx formulas](power-apps-ideas-transform.md).

> [!NOTE]
> This capability only works on the **Items** property of [Gallery](controls/control-gallery.md) and [Data table](controls/control-data-table.md) controls. See [limitations](#limitations), [supported/unsupported capabilities](#supported-and-unsupported-capabilities), and [supported functions](#supported-power-fx-functions) later for more information.

### Method 2: Transform examples to Power Fx formulas

With method 1, you can transform natural language to formulas. However, we know that not all requirements are easy to describe even in our daily language. One of the typical use case is data manipulation.

Let’s say you want to change a date field’s display format from the default to another format, and you don’t know how to describe that format. With Power Apps Ideas, you can now simply select that field, then in the ideas pane, enter your desired format, and press enter. One or a few formula suggestions will be popped out for you to select from.
Make sure your selection is a label within a Gallery field. Unlike method 1, method 2 doesn’t require you to use Dataverse specifically.
