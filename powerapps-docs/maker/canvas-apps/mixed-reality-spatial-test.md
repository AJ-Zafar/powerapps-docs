# Test for object fit using Measure in MR
Using the [Measure in MR](mixed-reality-component-measure-distance.md) control you can create a spatial test filter to validate whether an object with known width, depth, and height dimensions will fit in a space. This topic will guide you through creating a test app that you can use to validate fit including: 
- Inserting the **Measure In MR** component into an application to measure volumes
- Setting up **Expected Measurements (Items)** to help users maintain context in the MR experience
- Creating a spatial test filter using the **Bounding Width**, **Bounding Width**, and **Height** properties from the measurement outputs

## Prerequisites

- Create a blank canvas app ready for editing.
  - Go to the [Power Apps Studio](https://create.powerapps.com) and, under the **Start with a blank canvas or a template** section, select **Phone layout** on the **Blank app** tile.

> [!TIP]
> The MR components work best in well-lit environments with flat-textured surfaces. When establishing tracking, point the device at the surface you would like to track and slowly pan the device from right to left in broad arm motions. If tracking fails, exit and enter the MR view to reset the tracking and try again.
>
> LIDAR-enabled devices will also result in better tracking.

## Set up minimum dimensions input fields

First, we’ll set up the dimensions to validate for fit.

1. Open the **Insert** tab, and insert three **Text labels** into the application.

2. Change their **Text** properties to `"Minimum Width"`, `"Minimum Depth"`, and `"Minimum Height"` respectively.

3. Open the **Insert** tab again, and insert 3 **Text Input** controls, and position them next to the three labels inserted above.
5. In the **Properties** pane for each Text Input rename them to `minWidth`, `minDepth`, and `minHeight` respectively.
6. For each Text Input set the **Format** to **Number** and set the **Default** value to `1.0`

## Insert and bind the Measure in MR component

Next, we’ll set up the **Measure in MR** component to allow users to capture measurements, and bind the output value we will use to validate fit.

1. Open the **Insert** tab.
2. Expand **Mixed Reality**.
3. Select the component **Measure in MR** and place it at the bottom of the application.

4. Select the component by clicking on it to open the **Properties** Panel on the right hand side of the Studio.
5. Set **Measurement Type** to **Volume** from the drop down menu.
6. Set **Units of Measurement** to either **Feet** or **Meters**.

7. Next we'll define a table with a single expected measurement to provide an interaction hint during each user session. Under either the **Advanced** pane or the drop down menu on the **Formula Bar** at the top of the screen find the Items property and set it to: `Table({label:"Test Volume"})`
8. Also under the **Advanced** pane or the **Formula Bar** find the **ItemsLabels** property and set it to: `"Value"`

![Screenshot showing advanced property settings for Items and ItemsLabels.](./media/augmented-measure-fit-test/fit-test-advanced-properties-items.png "Screenshot showing advanced property settings for Items and ItemsLabels.")

9. Finally, in the **Advanced** pane set the OnMixedRealitySelect property to:
`Set(testVolume, LookUp(MeasureInMR1.Measurements, Label = "Test Volume"))`;

## Perform fit test and display result
1. Open the **Insert** tab, and insert 4 more **Text labels**.

![Screenshot showing four added text labels.](./media/augmented-measure-fit-test/fit-test-output-labels.png "Screenshot showing four added text labels.")

2. Set the first label’s **Text** property to:
```
If(IsBlankOrError(testVolume), "No Measurement captured",
    If(testVolume.Height >= Value(minHeight.Text) &&
        ((testVolume.BoundingWidth >= Value(minWidth.Text) && testVolume.BoundingDepth >= Value(minDepth.Text)) ||
        (testVolume.BoundingWidth >= Value(minDepth.Text) && testVolume.BoundingDepth >= Value(minWidth.Text))),
    "Fit Test Succeeded", "Fit Test Failed"))
```

3. Set the text property for the second label to:
 `Concatenate("Bounding Width: ", Text(testVolume.BoundingWidth))`
4. Set the text property for the third label to:
 `Concatenate("Bounding Depth: ", Text(testVolume.BoundingDepth))`
5. Set the text property for the fourth label to:
 `Concatenate("Bounding Height: ", Text(testVolume.Height))`

## Testing the application
Now, enter preview mode and click on the MeasureInMR button. You should see the labels above get populated with data. You can test that the bindings are working as expected by changing values in the three text input fields to verify that the filter is updating properly. The values for **Bounding Width** and **Bounding Depth** should be interchangeable and may be swapped when performing the test. After saving and publishing the application you can open it on a Mixed Reality enabled device to test whether an object with the specified dimensions will fit within the bounds of any measurement captured.

## Filtering a data source
This sample application only tests for a single set of user specified dimensions, but could be expanded to work as a filter for any data source by applying the formula as a **Filter** predicate. For example, let's say our app contains a reference to a Dataverse table named **Products** which includes three columns **Width**, **Depth**, and **Height** corresponding to each product's dimensions. To filter the collection to only those that would fit within a measured volume we can apply the following formula:
```
If(IsBlankOrError(testVolume), Products,
    Filter(Products, testVolume.Height >= Height &&
        ((testVolume.BoundingWidth >= Width && testVolume.BoundingDepth >= Depth) ||
        (testVolume.BoundingWidth >= Depth && testVolume.BoundingDepth >= Width))))
```

> [!NOTE]
> The **BoundingWidth**, **BoundingDepth**, and **Height** properties represent the smallest possible box that can fully encapsulate a measured volume. For irregularly shaped measurements it is possible that this will be an overestimate of the enclosed region, so this approach should be used as an estimate to help validate or narrow down results, but would not guarantee fit in all scenarios.

## Other mixed-reality controls

- View 3D content with the **[View in 3D](mixed-reality-component-view-3d.md)** component.
- Measure distance, area, and volume with the **[Measure in mixed reality](mixed-reality-component-measure-distance.md)** component.
- Create and view predefined 3D shapes with the **[View shape in mixed reality](mixed-reality-component-view-shape.md)** component
