# Find out who's working on an app

Use copresence to identify individuals working on the same app as you. Copresence offers the following advantages:

- Displaying the names and icons of other makers who are currently using the app and may be making changes. 
- The left-hand navigation pane in Power Apps Stuido displays the app's structure, indicating which part of the app is being worked on. 
- You'll receive notifications when the maker that's currently editing the app makes changes and save it. To ensure you do not overwrite someone else's work or lose your own, you will be prompted to refresh the app and stay on the most recent version. 
- The name of the maker who made the first or last save will be displayed.
