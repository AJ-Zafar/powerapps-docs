# Find out who is involved in developing the app

Use copresence to identify individuals working on the same app as you. Copresence offers several advantages, including displaying the names and icons of individuals who are currently using the app and may be making modifications. You can communicate with these individuals via email or Teams. The left-hand navigation pane displays the app's structure, indicating which part of the app is being worked on. You will receive notifications when other makers make changes and save them. To ensure you do not overwrite someone else's work or lose your own, you will be prompted to refresh the app and stay on the most recent version. The name of the maker who made the first or last save will be displayed. For more information, see Notifications.
