# Create a canvas app from an image (preview)

[This article is pre-release documentation and is subject to change.]

Generally, app making journey begins with a "design" phase. And often the design will end up in the format of a paper sketch, PPT, pdf or even a screenshot of a legacy app which inspired you. Creating an app from such designs takes time. The **Image to app** capability in Power Apps allows you to create apps from your design images faster, easier, and through a simple interface. This feature makes app creation possible for designers, users, administrators, and makers all alike.

All you need to do is ensure the image adheres to the required guidelines. And an app is generated for you with the controls identified from the design image you provided. Furthermore, it can help you create your own table in Microsoft Dataverse by extracting fields from the picture you upload so you don't need to manually add columns one by one.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - This is a preview feature.
> - [!INCLUDE[cc_preview_features_definition](../../includes/cc-preview-features-definition.md)]

## Prerequisites

- A Power Apps license. If you don't have a license for Power Apps, you can [sign-up for free](../signup-for-powerapps.md).
- If you're using your own image, the image file extension must be .jpg or .png. Also, the image must contain a clearly legible one-page form with a light background color.

## Create an app

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/).

1. Select **+ Create** from the left-pane.

    :::image type="content" source="media/app-from-image/select-create.png" alt-text="Select Create from the left-pane":::

1. Select **Image (preview)**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/app-from-image/select-image.png" alt-text="Select Image (preview) from the available cards.":::

1. Review the acceptable and unacceptable sample input images. Use **Next** to view the next screens. Also, be sure to review the tips on the right-hand side of the screen. Once done, select **Next** button on the bottom-right side of the screen.

1. Enter a name for the app.

1. Upload your own image. If you don't have an image ready, you can also use one of the available sample images.

    > [!NOTE]
    > When using your own image, ensure the image meets the image requirements mentioned in the prerequisites.

1. Layout will be automatcially picked for you based on the size of the image, but you should feel free to change if recommended doesn't fit your needs.

    :::image type="content" source="media/app-from-image/choose-image.png" alt-text="Provide image name, image type, and layout.":::

1. Select **Next**.

1. Depending on the supplied image, components of the app are created and available for you to change as required. For example, in the following sample image, the input below the **First Name** is used as an **Text input** control. You can select it, and edit the tag with a different type of control if necessary.

    You can also select on empty space and draw a new tag. Once drawn, choose a type of control that you want to associate the tag with.

    :::image type="content" source="media/app-from-image/design-components.png" alt-text="Design components for the app by selecting tags or creating a new tag and then choosing the tag control.":::

    > [!TIP]
    > Select the **Guidance** tab on the right-side of the screen to see details about different tags, and controls they correlate to.

1. Select to create the Dataverse tables, or skip creating the tables and just create the app based on the design (without the app connected to any table).

    :::image type="content" source="media/app-from-image/setup-data.png" alt-text="Choose to create a new table, or continue without creating a table now.":::

    If you choose to skip the table creation, select **Create** and the app will be created for you. Later, you can add [data connections](connections-list.md) to your app to connect the app with your data.

    > [!NOTE]
    > - The option to create a new table will be disabled if you don't have Dataverse in your environment, or if you don't have the required permissions to create a Dataverse table.
    > - Skip creating a new table if you want to use an existing table from Dataverse, or want to use any other data source.

1. If you chose to create the table in Dataverse, you can now edit the table and column details. Select a tag to change the column properties such as **Display Name**, **Name**, and **Data type**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/app-from-image/design-table.png" alt-text="Design the table, change columns and their properties.":::

    > [!NOTE]
    >You can also select the **Table properties** option on the right-side of the screen to update the new table's name, schema name, and change the primary column.

    Upon selecting **Next**, you'll be able to review the table and column structure.

    :::image type="content" source="media/app-from-image/review-table.png" alt-text="Review and confirm the table and column schema structure.":::

    Once you've completed the review, select **Create** to create the app.

1. The app gets created, and Power Apps Studio opens so you can start customizing the app further.

    :::image type="content" source="media/app-from-image/app-created.png" alt-text="The app has been created and opened in Power Apps Studio for you to customize.":::

    If you chose to create a new table, you'll also see the table added as the data source from the data pane on the left-side of the studio.

    :::image type="content" source="media/app-from-image/data-source.png" alt-text="The table has been created and added to the app.":::

1. If necessary, customize the app by [adding and configuring more controls](add-configure-controls.md). Once done, [save and publish](save-publish-app.md) the app, and share with other [users](share-app.md) and [guests](share-app-guests.md).

## Limitations

- Only images with the file extension of .jpg or .png are supported. If you have a design image with another file extension, save the image file with .jpg/.png file extension to use with this feature.
- Only canvas apps are supported.
- Supported controls:  [Button](controls/control-button.md), [Check box](controls/control-check-box.md), [Combo box](controls/control-combo-box.md), [Data cards](working-with-cards.md), [Date picker](controls/control-date-picker.md), [Edit form](controls/control-form-detail.md), [Label](controls/control-text-box.md), [Radio](controls/control-radio.md), [Rating](controls/control-rating.md), [Slider](controls/control-slider.md), [Text input](controls/control-text-input.md), [Toggle](controls/control-toggle.md)

- Complex forms, forms with colored backgrounds, multi-page forms, and forms with underlined input boxes aren't supported.
- Each time, you can upload only one image to create an app.
- Limited support for [Power Fx](formula-reference.md). For example, depending on the supplied image that has a button, the corresponding Power Fx formula may or may not get generated.
- App styling conversion won't be exactly pixel-perfect as an image. Instead, default themes including font size and color are used while creating the app.
- Support for responsiveness is limited. More information: [Building responsive canvas apps](build-responsive-apps.md)
