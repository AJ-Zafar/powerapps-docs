The ability to create apps from [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) design files directly helps bridge the gap between design and development, and accelerates the app development process. It allows developers and designers to collaborate effectively to deliver great end user experiences with low cost and effort.  

Designers can create designs in Figma using the [Create apps from Figma UI kit](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2193981), just like they do with any other UI kits. Once designs are created, developers or designers can use the link to the design file in Power Apps and create an app in a few minutes. The design frames are automatically converted into the screens in Power Apps. Once the app screens are ready, you can extend this app by [connecting to data](../add-data-connection.md), [adding app logic](../working-with-formulas.md), adding additional [screens](../build-responsive-apps.md) and [controls](../add-configure-controls.md).

## Design your app

[Design](design-using-kit.md) your app in Figma using the [Create apps from Figma UI kit](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2193981). Use the components [supported](supported-components.md) by the kit while designing the app screens and controls.

## Create app from your design

After you've finalized the desired app design, use the quick and easy steps to provide the Figma file details and an access token to [create a canvas app from the Figma design](create-app-from-figma.md).

## Extend your app with data

Connect your app to [data](../add-data-connection.md), and customize further by [adding app logic](../working-with-formulas.md), adding additional [screens](../build-responsive-apps.md) and [controls](../add-configure-controls.md)
