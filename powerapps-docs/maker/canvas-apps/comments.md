# Add comments in a canvas app


Easily add comments when you’re building a canvas app in Power Apps Studio. Use comments to help your team review the app and provide feedback, or provide additional information on implementation details in your app. 

You can add comments to different components or pages.

Legend

1. **Tree view**: Select a screens from the tree view and right-click to add a **New comment**.
2. **Component**: In the canvas area, right-click on a component to add a **New comment**.
3. **App actions**: Select **Comments** > **New** and then add your comments. 


## Use @mention in comments to tag someone for feedback

Connect with your team of makers as you collaborate on creating your app. You can tag people in the comments by using **@**+ their name.

If you tag a maker that doesn’t have access to the app then you’ll be prompted to share the app with them.

When your tagged in a comment, you'll receive an email letting you know that you've been tagged in a comment with the name of the user that tagged and the specific app. The email will contain the comment text and also have a link to that comment.
