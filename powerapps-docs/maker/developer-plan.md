---

The Power Apps Developer Plan gives you a free development environment to build
and test with Power Apps, Power Automate, and Microsoft Dataverse. The plan
enables you to:

-   Create apps and flows without writing code, with full-featured Power Apps
    and Power Automate development tools. Easily share and collaborate on these
    solutions with others.

-   Connect to any data source by using 400+ [out of the box
    connectors](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/connections-list) or
    by creating your own [custom
    connectors](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/register-custom-api).

-   With [Dataverse](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/common-data-service/entity-reference/introduction), utilize
    a fully managed, scalable data platform, including support for common
    business app actions. Use out-of-the-box common tables or build your own
    data schema.

-   Create additional environments to exercise application lifecycle management
    (coming soon).

-   Export the solutions you create in your individual environment, and [publish
    them on Microsoft
    AppSource](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/developer/data-platform/publish-app-appsource) so
    your customers can test-drive them.

Improvements from the previous version (Power Apps Community Plan)
------------------------------------------------------------------

In May 2021, we have extended the capabilities of the Power Apps Community Plan
to meet the needs of developers and have re-branded it as the Power Apps
Developer Plan. Key changes are the ability to share apps with team members for
development and testing purposes, increased capability allocations, and the
ability to create additional environments to support ALM scenarios (coming
soon). Existing Power Apps Community Plan users will have no changes to their
plan.

Who can sign up for the Power Apps Developer Plan?
--------------------------------------------------

Anyone with a [work or school email
address](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/signup-for-powerapps#faq) can
sign up for the Power Apps Developer Plan.

Where can I sign up for the Power Apps Developer Plan?
------------------------------------------------------

Sign up on the [Power Apps Developer Plan
website](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/communityplan). If you are an existing
Power Apps user, you can also [create a developer
environment](https://make.powerapps.com/community/signup).

After signing up for the Developer Plan, you will be redirected to the [Power
Apps
site](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc). You
may need to select your developer environment in the top right of the screen. It
will be shown with your name, for example 'John Doe's environment'. (If there is
already an environment with that name, the individual environment will be named
'John Doe's (1) environment'.) You will need to use this developer environment,
instead of your tenant’s default environment, to use certain capabilities such
as premium and custom connectors.

What are the capacity limits for the individual environment?
------------------------------------------------------------

| **WHAT ARE THE CAPACITY LIMITS FOR THE DEVELOPER ENVIRONMENT?** |            |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| **Capacity**                                                    | **Limits** |
| Flow runs/month                                                 | 750        |
| Database size                                                   | 2GB        |
|                                                                 |            |

You cannot increase capacity by applying add-ons to the quantities that we
include. If you hit capacity limits, we recommend purchasing Power Apps Per User
Plan. Learn more about it from the [Power Apps pricing
page](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/pricing/).

** Note**

The capacity entitlements of the developer environment, whether used or not,
does not contribute to your company's overall quota.

Publishing to Microsoft AppSource
---------------------------------

Do you have an app you would like to share with customers? We now support Power
Apps solutions on [Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/) as a
way for you to share apps and flows with customers, and generate leads for your
business. For more information, see [Publish your app on
AppSource](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/developer/data-platform/publish-app-appsource).

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

### What should I do if reach the capacity limits of the environment?

There is a limited capacity provided because this environment is meant for
development and test purposes, not for production use. The capacity provided is:

| **WHAT SHOULD I DO IF REACH THE CAPACITY LIMITS OF THE ENVIRONMENT?** |            |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| **Capacity**                                                          | **Limits** |
| Flow runs/month                                                       | 750        |
| Database size                                                         | 2 GB       |

If you reach one or more capacity limits, we recommend you purchase a plan that
supports production use. Learn more about our plans on the [Power Apps pricing
page](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/pricing/).

### Can I transfer the apps, flows, and other resources created in the developer environment, to another environment?

Yes, you should be able to export the resources from this environment to other
environments. For more information,
see [Solutions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/data-platform/solutions-overview).

### Will my Power Apps Developer Plan subscription ever expire?

You can continue using your Power Apps Developer Plan for free as long as there
is active usage and there is no abuse of the Plan (e.g. apps are not used for
production purposes and the capacity limits are not exceeded).

### Can I get or create multiple developer environments?

Currently, no, you can only have one developer environment, which is created for
you by Power Apps when you sign up for the Developer Plan.

Coming soon is the ability to create additional environments to support ALM
scenarios. Stay tuned for more details.

### What's the difference between Power Apps Plan Trial and Power Apps Developer Plan; and which one should I sign up for?

Both Power Apps Plan Trial and Power Apps Developer Plan are free, but are
created for different purposes:

**Power Apps Plan Trial** gives you the Power Apps per user plan for 30 days.
This is meant for trying out production Power Apps applications. Once your trial
expires, you can purchase a plan. If you are already using Power Apps with
Office 365 or Dynamics 365, this is the right plan to try out the premium
functionalities of Power Apps, which are available with paid Power Apps plans.

**Power Apps Developer Plan** gives you perpetual access to the same Power Apps
functionality available in paid plans (aligned with Trials), including Dataverse
and Power Automate, but in a developer environment that is for development and
test use only. A paid plan is required to deploy or run solutions in a
production environment for production use.

### Can I sign up with my personal account?

No, you can only sign up with your [work or school
account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/signup-for-powerapps#faq).
We currently do not support signing up with a personal account.

### Can I delete my developer environment?

Tenant-level admins have the permissions needed to delete a developer
environment through the user interface. An end user can delete a developer
environment through a [Power Apps PowerShell admin
cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/powerapps-powershell#power-apps-cmdlets-for-administrators-preview).

PowerShellCopy

Remove-AdminPowerAppEnvironment -EnvironmentName \<environmentGuid\>

### Can I reset my developer environment?

Resetting a developer environment is not currently supported; however, it can be
deleted. The next time the Developer Plan licensed user signs into the Power
Apps Maker portal a new developer environment will be created. The user can then
provision a Dataverse database in the environment. At present, the only way to
remove the Developer Plan from a user is for a tenant-level admin to block all
"internal" consent plans in the tenant using PowerShell. See [Block trial
licenses
commands](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/powerapps-powershell#block-trial-licenses-commands)
