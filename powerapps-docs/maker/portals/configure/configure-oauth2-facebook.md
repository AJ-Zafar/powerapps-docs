# Configure the Facebook provider for portals

As explained in [Configure an OAuth 2.0 provider for portals](configure-oauth2-provider.md), Facebook is one of several identity providers that use the OAuth 2.0 protocol. To get started with configuring Facebook as the identity provider, select **Configure** from the [provider settings](use-simplified-authentication-configuration.md#add-configure-or-delete-an-identity-provider) page.

## Step 1. Create a Facebook app

To use **Facebook** as an identity provider, you need to [create an app in Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com) with a redirect URL. For detailed steps about creating an app in Facebook, refer to [Facebook for Developers: Create an app](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/create-an-app).

> [!NOTE]
> The Reply URL is used by the Facebook app to redirect users to the portal after the authentication succeeds. If your portal uses a custom domain name, you might have a different URL than the one provided here.​

**To create an app in Facebook**

1. Open [Facebook Developers App Dashboard](https://developers.facebook.com/apps).
1. Select products, permissions, and features, such as **Business**.
1. Select **Continue**.
1. Enter **App Display Name**.
1. Select **App Purpose**.
1. Select **Create App**.
1. While on the dashboard for the new app, go to **Settings** &gt; **Basic** tab and add the following details:
    - **App Domains** (optional). For example, `contoso.powerappsportals.com`.
    -  **Privacy Policy URL**: URL for your privacy policy, must be accessible anonymously.
    - **Contact Email**: *&lt;email address of your choice&gt;*
    - Select **Add Platform**, and then select **Website** with **Site URL**: `https://contoso.powerappsportals.com/` or `https://contoso.powerappsportals.com/signin-facebook`

6. Select **Save Changes**.
7. Go to **Status & Review** &gt; **Status** tab.
8. Select **Yes** when prompted to make the app and all its features available to the general public. You must have filled in the valid data earlier in step 5 to enable this setting.

## Step 2. Configure site settings

After you've created the app in Facebook, configure the site settings for the provider:

- **Client ID**: A unique app ID generated by Facebook for your app.​
- **Client Secret**:  The app secret for your Facebook app.​

## (Optional) Step 3. Additional settings

To configure **Additional settings** for the Facebook provider, see [Configure additional settings for OAuth 2.0 providers](configure-oauth2-settings.md).
