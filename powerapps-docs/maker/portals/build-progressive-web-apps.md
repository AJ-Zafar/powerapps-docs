1. In portals Studio, select **Progressive web app**.

1. Select **Customize PWA** under **Customization**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > After customizing PWA, you need to select **Browse website** to clear cache. This will start reflecting changes instantly.

## Manage offline behavior

PWA offers support for a smooth navigation experience when the device being used is offline or disconnected from the internet. You can choose the pages within portals that will have this read-only offline capability, and a message page for the rest of the portal capability that isn't enabled for offline access.

### Offline pages for portal

To configure offline pages for the portal using PWA:

1. In portals Studio, select **Progressive web app**.

1. Select **Customize PWA**.

1. Select **Manage offline pages** under **Offline behavior**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/progressive-web-apps/offline-behavior.png" alt-text="Selecting pages for offline mode." :::

1. Select the pages that you want to enable for offline access using PWA.

    :::image type="content" source="media/progressive-web-apps/manage-offline.png" alt-text="Managing offline pages." :::

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure you consider the storage limitations for the end-user devices when configuring offline access for pages using PWA. Storage requirement for PWA access exceeding the available storage on a device will result in the entire portal to be unavailable for offline access. We recommend that you test the offline access, and only cache the most important pages that must be available offline. Offline pages can only show information. Pages that allow form submissions or run queries won't work for offline access.

### Set up offline error page

When the device is offline, the page you configure as the offline message page appears to users if they try to access pages that aren't enabled for offline access using the previous setting.

To set up the offline message page:

1. In portals Studio, select **Progressive web app**.

1. Under **Customization**, select **Offline message page**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/progressive-web-apps/offline-message.png" alt-text="Configuring offline message page." :::

1. Customize the page like any other portals page.

1. Change page template to suite your business needs.

    :::image type="content" source="media/progressive-web-apps/edit-webpage.png" alt-text="Customizing offline message page in portals Studio." border="false" :::

> [!NOTE]
> - You can't change the Title, and the Partial URL ("*/default-offline-page*") for offline page. A default offline page will be rendered to end users if the offline page is missing.
> - After managing offline experiences of PWA in studio, you need to select **Browse website** to clear cache. This will start reflecting changes instantly.

### Browse your portal in offline mode

After you've enabled offline pages, you can now use a mobile device in offline mode and browse through different pages enabled for offline access.

To get started with offline browsing:

1. Browse to your portal using a web browser on your mobile device in online mode.

1. Select **Add to Home screen**, or a similar option. For example, on Android device, the option might be **+ Add to**, and then, **App screen**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/progressive-web-apps/add-to-home.png" alt-text="Adding PWA app to home page on mobile device." border="false":::

    > [!NOTE]
    > This action downloads portal pages enabled for offline browsing, and may take a while depending on the network bandwidth, and the selected pages for offline browsing.

1. Enable offline mode in your mobile device.

1. Open your portal from the home screen. You'll see a notification on the top reminding the browsing session being in offline mode, the default offline message page appears if you select any pages that aren't enabled for offline browsing.

    :::image type="content" source="media/progressive-web-apps/pwa-offline.png" alt-text="Read-only page in offline mode for a PWA app.":::   :::image type="content" source="media/progressive-web-apps/not-connected.png" alt-text="Not connected to the internet page in PWA app." :::

## Distribute your app

### Distribute your app using a browser

Once your portal is enabled as a PWA, your users can pin Power Apps portals as an app to the home screen on a their device.  This is supported in all platforms (android/iOS/windows) as well as all form factors (mobile/desktop/tablet).

### Distribute your app through an app store

You can create an app package for your portal's PWA and publish the package to different app stores such as Microsoft Windows Store and Google Play Android Store

To create app package, select **Create app package** under **App package** in **Progressive web app** in portals Studio.

:::image type="content" source="media/progressive-web-apps/open-pwa-builder.png" alt-text="Opening PWA builder to create app package in portals Studio." border="false":::

You'll be taken to [PWA builder](https://www.pwabuilder.com/) where you can create app package for various app stores.

Package created from pwabuilder contains:

- .apk file to test the app

- .aab file that can be published in app store.

- Step-by-step document to publish app.

For Android platform, you can also update the android certificate using the option **Update android certificate**.

:::image type="content" source="media/progressive-web-apps/update-android.png" alt-text="Menu item in portals Studio to update android certificate." border="false":::

Update the title and the SHA-256 certificate fingerprint to update digital asset links file (assetlinks.json) that proves ownership of your PWA.

## Advanced configuration

PWA capability for portals uses the following configuration that can be updated using the Portal Management app.

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend that you use Power Apps portals Studio to work with PWA feature instead of customizations using Portal Management app.

| **Type** | **Name** | **Description** | **Value** |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| Site Setting | PWAFeature | Site setting to enable PWA for the portal | { "status": "enable" }<br /></br>{ "status": "disable" } |
| Web file | PWAManifestjson.en-US.json | Manifest file of PWA is stored as this JSON web file. | This web file contains all customization-related properties of PWA (such as, app name, splash screen color). |
