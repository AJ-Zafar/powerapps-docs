# What is Power Apps portals?

> [!NOTE]
> Effective November 2020:
> - Common Data Service has been renamed to Microsoft Dataverse. [Learn more](https://aka.ms/PAuAppBlog)
> - Some terminology in Microsoft Dataverse has been updated. For example, *entity* is now *table* and *field* is now *column*. [Learn more](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2147247)
>
> Power Apps portals articles will be updated soon to reflect the latest terminology.

Power Apps makers can now create a powerful new type of experience: external-facing websites that allow users outside their organizations to sign in with a wide variety of identities, create and view data in Microsoft Dataverse, or even browse content anonymously. The full capabilities of Dynamics 365 Portals, previously offered only as an add-on to customer engagement apps (Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Marketing, and Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation), are now available standalone in Power Apps.  

These capabilities feature a revamped end-to-end experience for makers to quickly create a website and customize it with pages, layout, and content. Makers can reuse page designs through templates, add forms and views to display key data from Dataverse, and publish to users.
