Convert your functional portal as a progressive web app with native app like look & feel right from portal studio.​

Portals can leverage Progress web app technology to provide multi-platform support to create an app that will work on all platforms (android/iOS/windows/chromebooks) and form factors (mobile/desktop/tablet).

Progressive Web Apps (PWA) are built for cross-platform interoperability through browser support that provides users a native app-like experience. PWA brings a seamless experience for users across different web browsers. These Apps can be installed from browser as well as through app stores (Android/Windows/Chrome store). 

> [!Note]
> The iOS app store is not supported.

With PWA, you can pin Power Apps portals as an app to the home screen on a mobile device or install it from the app store. This capability enables external and internal customers to use portals as an app for both online and offline scenarios. As a maker, you can choose to enable specific pages in a portal for read-only offline availability. 

The following graphics illustrate the user experience when adding the portal on a home screen using the browser that installs the portal as a PWA.

Users can also install the portal from the store if you choose to create an app package and publish the app to the device store.
