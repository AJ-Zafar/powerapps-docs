Convert your functional portal as a progressive web app with native app like look & feel right from portal studio in low code-no code fashion in just few steps.​

We are leveraging Progressive web app technology (PWA) to convert portal to multi-platform supported app which works all platforms (android/iOS/windows) as well as all form factors (mobile/desktop/tablet). It will even work on specialized platforms like chrome books.

Progressive Web Apps (PWA) are built for cross-platform interoperability through browser support that provides users a native app-like experience. PWA brings a seamless experience for users across different web browsers. These Apps can be installed from browser as well as through app stores (Android/Windows/Chrome store, no iOS today). 

With PWA, you can pin Power Apps portals as an app to the home screen on a mobile device or install it from the app store. This capability enables external and internal customers to use portals as an app for both online and offline scenarios. As a maker, you can choose to enable specific pages in a portal for read-only offline availability. 

The following graphics illustrate the user experience when adding the portal on a home screen using the browser that installs the portal as a PWA.

Users can also install the portal from the store if you choose to create an app package and publish the app to the device store.
