# Solutions area (preview)

The solutions area makes it easier for you to work with solution objects and subcomponents in your solutions. To use this experience, [Enable solution preview](#enable-solution-preview).

## Solutions area overview

1. Panes - The left navigation pane consists of the following areas:
   - **Overview**. Provides details about the solution, such as display name, name, created on date, version, managed or unmanaged, publisher, description, and whether the solution is a patch.
   - **Objects**. Presents a tree view of all objects within the solution. Select an object from the actions pane (4) to view or edit it.
   - **History**.  Presents the solution operations completed on the solution. An operation can be a solution import, export, or uninstall. The solution history displays information such as solution version, solution publisher, type of operation, operation start and end time, and operation result status.
2. Tree view. From the Object pane, the tree view displays a list that you can browse to find an object to open it or one of the objectâ€™s subcomponents.
3. Command bar. Contextual command bar to perform actions on the solution, objects, or subcomponents.
4. Actions pane. Displays information that can be viewed and/or opened for editing from the Objects pane.
5. Search. Locate objects and subcomponents that are in the solution.
