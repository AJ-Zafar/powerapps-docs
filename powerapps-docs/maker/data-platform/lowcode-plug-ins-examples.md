# Example Dataverse low-code plug-ins (experimental)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

The goal of these plug-ins is to help you get started by simply integrating into your app. You will understand the authoring experience includes authoring Dataverse customAPIs backed by powerfx expressions which can trigger actions internal or external to Dataverse. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - This is an experimental feature. Use this if you're an early adopter, see something useful to you, and would like to help test the feature.
> - Experimental features arenâ€™t meant for production use and may have restricted functionality. These features are available before an official release so that customers can get early access and provide feedback.
> - Experimental features can radically change or completely disappear at any time. For this reason the feature is not enabled by default and you must explicitly opt in to use it.
