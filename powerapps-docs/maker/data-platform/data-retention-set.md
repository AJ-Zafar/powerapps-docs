# Set a data retention policy for a table

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

This article explains how to setup a data retention policy for a Microsoft Dataverse table.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - This is a preview feature.
> - [!INCLUDE [cc-preview-features-definition](../../includes/cc-preview-features-definition.md)]
> - For public preview, only non-production environments are allowed for previewing the long-term data retention feature.

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites must be completed before you can set a table for long term data retention.

<!-- Add this back upon GA
### Prerequisite 1: The environment must be a managed environment

Only managed environments can use the long term data retention feature. More information: [Managed environments overview](/power-platform/admin/managed-environment-overview)  -->

### Prerequisite 1: Enable an environment for long term retention

Power Platform admins use the Power Platform admin center settings to enable or disable environments for data retention.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - By default, Dataverse long term retention is enabled in all Power Platform environments.
>
> - If an environment isn't enabled for long term retention, you can't set up a retention policy.

1. Go to the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com).
1. Select the environment you want to use for long term data retention.
1. Select **Settings** > **Product** > **Features**.
1. Scroll down, and select **Long term data retention in Dataverse**.
1. Select **Save**.

## Prerequisite 2: Enable a table for long term retention

Makers can enable or disable data retention for any table. Before setting up a retention policy to retain historical cold data (non-active data) long term in a Dataverse long term storage, makers should enable retention for the parent root table.

> [!NOTE]
> When a parent table is enabled for retention, all the cascade related child tables are automatically enabled. You can't disable retention for a child table when the parent table is already enabled for retention. For example, assume a custom table and notes table are child tables of the case table. The child tables can't be disabled for retention when the parent case table is enabled. Maker can disable the parent table for retention and separately enable the child table for retention.

Some tables, such as the case <sup>1</sup> table, have long term retention enabled by default.

1. Sign into [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc), go to **Tables**, and then open the table you want. [!INCLUDE [left-navigation-pane](../../includes/left-navigation-pane.md)]
1. Select **Properties** on the command bar, expand **Advanced options**, and then select the **Enable long term retention** property.

1. Select **Save**.

The save process can take up to 15 minutes, as Dataverse enables this property for all cascade-related child tables. Notice that the larger the number of cascade-related tables, the longer it will take to complete the operation.

> [!NOTE]
> The long term retention property is disabled if the environment isn't enabled for long term retention. More information: [Prerequisite 2: Enable an environment for long term retention](#prerequisite-2-enable-an-environment-for-long-term-retention)

<sup>1</sup>Requires a Dynamics 365 app, such as Dynamics 365 Customer Service.

### Prerequisite 3: Create Dataverse views for policy criteria

Dataverse views are used to determine which table rows are marked for retention using a long-term retention policy. Before setting up a data retention policy, you must set up a Dataverse view as the criteria for retention.

Once you have a Dataverse view for use in a particular long term retention policy, you should test the view result. A good practice is to modify the view query with a `TOP N` statement and test it to ensure that the result set returned is as expected. This is always recommended especially when the number of rows is large. 

For example, consider a Dataverse view created to select all closed cases from the year 2015. The number of cases could be potentially very large. Therefore, you should add a `TOP N`, such as *TOP 10*, to the view and test it to confirm the sample set of the retrieved cases.

During data retention, rows from the parent table and all cascade related child tables are included for data retention as cold data. In the previous example, the parent cases might have associated rows from child cascade tables, for example notes, task, and custom tables. The retention policy ensures that the case record and all its related child rows are marked and retained as cold data in Dataverse. In addition, lookup values in the case table, as an example, are de-normalized with the ID and name values made available as part of the retained cold data. This allows in many scenarios for a single query to retrieve the relevant data.

For information about how to create a table view, go to [Create and edit public or system views](../model-driven-apps/create-or-edit-model-driven-app-view.md).

## Setup a retention policy

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Once data is moved to long term (non-active) data store it can't be moved back to the active data store.
>
> - When a retention policy is run, the process makes API requests in Microsoft Power Platform. These requests are counted towards the existing API requests available with your plan. More information: [Requests limits and allocations](/power-platform/admin/api-request-limits-allocations)
>
> - To complete this task you must have the Power Platform administrator role.

1. Make sure you've met all the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) for long term data retention.
1. Sign into [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc), and then on the left navigation pane select **Retention policies**. [!INCLUDE [left-navigation-pane](../../includes/left-navigation-pane.md)]
1. On the command bar, select **New retention policy**.
1. Complete the following properties for the retention policy.
   - **Table**. Select the parent root table that will be use to set up a policy to retain historical cold data in long term storage.
   - **Name**. Enter a name for the retention policy.
   - **Criteria**. Select a view from the list. The view should have been previously created and tested to ensure the right historical data was selected. If the view hasn't been created, create it.
   - **Schedule - Start date**. Enter the date you want the policy to run for the first time. The policy runs during the off hours of your environmentâ€™s region.
   - **Frequency**. The choices available are **Once**, **Daily**, **Weekly**, **Monthly**, and **Yearly**.
