# Create a cloud flow to view Dataverse long term retained data

Create a cloud flow to view read-only rows in long term data retention in Microsoft Dataverse. For more information about long term data retention in Dataverse, go to [Dataverse long term data retention overview (preview)](data-retention-overview.md).

The cloud flow generates an email used to retrieve retained data in Excel. If there are retained attachments associated with rows from Dataverse, it's included in Excel.

Creating the flow requires the following high level steps:

1. Pass query parameters in a FetchXML to create an Excel file with retained data.
1. Set a condition to determine if the Excel file has been created. Download the Excel file. Pass the required retrieval criteria parameters (table and FetchXml).
1. Create an Excel file with the retrieved data.
1. Send an email to recipients with the Excel file attached.  

Make sure to check your junk mail folder if you donâ€™t see an email after running a flow successfully.
