# `avoid-dom-form`
Don't use the Document Object Model (DOM) of model-driven apps directly. This isn't a supported approach in Dynamics 365 of Power Apps. Please use the supported [Client API Object Model](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-apps/developer/model-driven-apps/clientapi/reference) instead.
