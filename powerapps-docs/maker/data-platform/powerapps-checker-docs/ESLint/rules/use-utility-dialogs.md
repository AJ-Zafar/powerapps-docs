# `use-utility-dialogs`

Use Web API dialogs in form and ribbon commands. 

## Recommendation
Alerts should be replaced with `Xrm.Navigation.openAlertDialog`,
while confirms should be replaced with `Xrm.Navigation.openConfirmDialog`. For more details, see [Xrm.Navigation](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-apps/developer/model-driven-apps/clientapi/reference/xrm-navigation).
