After creating a continuous pipeline of data from Dataverse to your Synapse workspace with Azure Synapse Link for Dataverse, you can read the incremental updates of a specified time interval. Every Dataverse table exported with Azure Synapse Link for Dataverse contains a *SinkModifiedOn* column which can be used to get the incremental updates.

This section describes the prerequisites necessary to ingest exported Dataverse data with Data Factory.

### Azure Synapse Link for Dataverse

This guide assumes that you've already exported Dataverse data by using [Azure Synapse Link for Dataverse](export-to-data-lake.md). **All tables must be exported with the append-only option.**

## Read the Incremental Updates of your Dataverse data

1. Navigate to you Azure Synapse Analytics workspace.

2. Select **Develop** from the left side panel, then select **+** > **SQL script**.

3. Paste the following SQL query and replace **CONTAINER_NAME** with the name of the container, **TABLE_NAME** with the name of the Dataverse table, and **TIMESTAMP_START** and **TIMESTAMP_END** with the time interval in UTC format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS).

```SQL
    SELECT * 
    FROM [CONTAINER_NAME].[dbo].[TABLE_NAME]
    WHERE [SinkModifiedOn] >= TIMESTAMP_START AND [SinkModifiedOn] <= TIMESTAMP_END
```

4. **Run** the query and a table containing the incremental updates to the Dataverse table from the specified time interval will be displayed.
