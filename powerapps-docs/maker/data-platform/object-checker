# Object checker overview

Object checker runs real-time diagnostics on objects within your solution. If issues are detected a recommendation will be returned for fixing the issue. This may include documentation, instructions, or a clickable action that will fix the issue for you. 

## Difference between object checker and solution checker
They are similar and share much of the same infrastructure. However, object checker runs **live diagnostics on the database** and can analyze issues based on the metadata and layering of a given solution object - regardless of which solution(s) the object is in. Therefore object checker is better suited for troubleshooting **ALM** related issues in **test and production environments.** 
Solution checker runs offline analysis on a single solution file and requires the solution to be exported. Solution checker is better suited for development environments or analyzing a solution prior to committing it to a source control repository.

## Example issues object checker detects

- Active layer hiding customizations
- Malformed or corrupted metadata
- Duplicate site maps
- Soft deleted apps causing upgrade failures

## Use object checker
1. Navigate to any solution containing the problematic object. You may run object checker within both managed and unmanaged solutions.
2. Select a single object
3. Click **Run**
4. Click **View results**
5. If issue(s) are detected, follow the prompt to resolve the issue(s)


## Current limitations
Object checker is currently only supported for model-driven apps and site maps. This is a framework that will grow to support other object types and additional rules over time.
