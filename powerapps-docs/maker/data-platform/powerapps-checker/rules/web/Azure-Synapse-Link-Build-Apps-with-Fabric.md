# Build Apps and automations, drive action with insights from Microsoft Fabric 

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

You might have explored Dataverse data with the Synapse lakehouse, SQL endpoint, or Power BI. You can also bring your own data into Fabric and combine, reshape, and aggregate data with data from Dataverse. You can use Fabric tools such as SQL, Spark, and dataflows to work with your data within Fabric. For example:
	• Combine financial data from Dynamics 365 with financial data from other systems to derive consolidated insights.
	• Merge historical data, ingested into OneLake from legacy systems, with current business data from Dynamics 365 and Dataverse.
	• Combine weblogs and telemetry data from your website with product and order details from Dynamics 365.
	• Apply machine learning and detect anomalies and exceptions within your data.
Insights aren't complete unless you can drive action and business processes. Bring data in OneLake into Dataverse as virtual tables and use that data to build apps in Power Apps or create business automations with Power Automate.
