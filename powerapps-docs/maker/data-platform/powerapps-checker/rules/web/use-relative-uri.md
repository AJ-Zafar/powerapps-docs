# `use-relative-uri`

Don't use absolute Microsoft Dataverse endpoint URLs.

## Recommendation

Don't use an absolute reference to a Microsoft Dataverse endpoint. Microsoft Dataverse endpoint URLs should be constructed using the appropriate client API function along with a relative path to the desired endpoint.
