# `use-relative-uri`

Don't use absolute Dataverse endpoint URLs. 

## Recommendation
Don't use an absolute reference to a Common Data Service for Apps endpoint. Common Data Service for Apps endpoint URLs should be constructed using the appropriate client API function along with a relative path to the desired endpoint.
