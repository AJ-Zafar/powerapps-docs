title: Dataverse long term data retention FAQ
summary: This article provides information on frequently asked questions about long term data reention with Microsoft Dataverse.
sections:
- name: General
  questions:
   - question: Can a data retention policy be set only on a particular table and not the related tables?
     answer: |
       No. Admins can set up a retention policy on a root table, such as the Dynamics 365 apps accounts table. Dataverse automatically sets all related child tables for data retention. So if the account row has related task rows, all task rows will also be set for data retention. 
       Admins can always set up a retention policy on a specific table with no related tables.

   - question: What about my existing custom Dataverse native delete action logic to ensure business rules are followed when any live data is deleted?
     answer: |
        All custom logic with Dataverse native delete actions will always be honored during the data retention process. 
      # Does this mean it is deleted?

   - question: Why can't I view some data in a table while a particular policy is being executed in the background that was a part of the policy criteria?
     answer: |
        Until all records are purged, records will be available for viewing. Retention is a multi-step process that includes reconciliation to confirm that all the records within the criteria are retained for long-term before delete from Dataverse. <b>We recommend that you set up long term retention only for non-active records, that are not actively required for your business operations.</b> 


   - question: If a policy run has errors, are the errors available for admin to view?
     answer: |
        Yes. Errors from a policy run are available in the run history details. More information: data-retention-manage.md#view-and-manage-retention-policies

   - question: Can a policy run be stopped?
     answer: | 
        No. A policy being executed currently can't be stopped.
