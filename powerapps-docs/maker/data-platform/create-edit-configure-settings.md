# Settings overview 
Settings are solution components that enable makers and administrators to quickly configure and customize apps to provide a tailored experience. Settings can be used to enable or disable features or configure feature behavior for one specific app or all apps within an environment.

Settings are made up of three sub-components: Setting definition, setting environment value and setting app value.

## Setting definition
A setting definition specifies the base properties of a settings like its name, description, data type, default value and more. Some of these properties cannot be updated once the setting has been created.

| Property | Description |
|:--------------|:-------------------------|
|**Display name** | The localizable display name of the setting |
|**Name** | The name of your setting is the unique name across your environment. A name will be generated for you based on the display name you provide. You cannot change the name after a setting has been created as it may be referenced in your applications or code. <br> The name will have a prefix that will be automatically generated by the system. This prefix is intended to give your objects a unique name if you wish to import them into another environment in the future (which would have a different prefix). |
|**Description** | The description helps others understand what the settings is used for. |
|**Release level** | Rrelease level is used to inform the framework and other consumers of the setting about the state of the feature that the setting is used with. |
|**Overridable** | Overridable enables a setting’s default value to be overridden by an environment or an app. You cannot change overridable after a setting has been created. |
|**Data type** | The data type of a setting controls how the setting’s value is stored. Currently suppoYou cannot change the data type after a setting has been created. |
|**Default value** | The default value of the setting |

Settting environment value can be used to override the setting's default value for an environment. Setting environment value applies to all apps in that environment.
If a setting environment value exists for a setting, all apps in that environment will get that value instead of the setting's default value. If no setting environment value exists for a setting, all apps in that environment will get the setting's default value.

Settting app value can be used to override both the setting's default value as well as any setting environment value created for that setting in that environment. Setting app value applies only to one specific app. If a setting app value exists for a setting, that app will get that value instead of the setting's default value. If no setting app value exists for a setting, that app will get the setting's default value.
