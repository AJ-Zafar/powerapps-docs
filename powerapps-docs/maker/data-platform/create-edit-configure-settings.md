# Use settings to provide tailored app experiences
Settings are solution components that enable makers and administrators to quickly configure and customize apps to provide a tailored experience. Settings can be used to enable or disable features or configure feature behavior for one specific app or all apps within an environment.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > - This is a preview feature and may not be available in all regions.
  > - [!INCLUDE[cc_preview_features_definition](../../includes/cc-preview-features-definition.md)]

Settings are made up of three sub-components: Setting definition, setting environment value, and setting app value.

| Sub-component | Description |
|:--------------|:-------------------------|
|**Setting definition** | A setting definition specifies the base properties of a settings like its name, description, data type and default value. |
|**Setting environment value** | Setting environment value is used to override the setting's default value for all apps in an environment. |
|**Setting app value** | Setting app value is used to override the setting's default value and any setting environment value for a specific app. |

> [!NOTE]
> To follow the steps listed below you need to have **Solution preview on**. When viewing the list of solutions, in the command bar, ensure you see **Solution preview on**. If you see **Solution preview off**, use the toggle to enable the preview.

## Setting definition
A setting definition specifies the base properties of a settings. The full list of properties that can be configured on a setting definition are listed below. Some of these properties cannot be changed after the setting has been created.

| Property | Description |
|:--------------|:-------------------------|
|**Display name** | The name displayed to consumers of the setting in all user interfaces where settings are displayed. |
|**Name** | The unique name of the setting in an environment.<br> Name is automatically generated based on the display name provided but can be changed before the settings is created. Once a setting is created the Name cannot be changed as it may be referenced in applications or code.<br> Name has a prefix that corresponds to the solution [publisher](create-solution.md#solution-publisher). This prefix is intended to give the setting a unique name if you wish to import them into another solution or environment in the future (which would have a different prefix). |
|**Description** | The description helps others understand what the setting is used for in all user interfaces where settings are displayed. |
|**Release level** | Release level is used to inform the framework and other consumers of the setting about the state of the feature that the setting is used with. Release level can be set to Generally available or Preview. |
|**Overridable** | Overridable enables a setting’s default value to be overridden by an environment (setting environment value) or an app (setting app value).<br> A setting that is overridable can be further configured to enable the override behavior for app and environment, environment only or app only.<br> Overridable cannot be changed after the setting has been created. |
|**Data type** | The data type of a setting controls how the setting’s value is stored. Data type can be set to Number, String or Yes/No. Data type cannot be changed after the setting has been created. |
|**Default value** | The default value specifies the setting's value that will be used unless it is overridden by a setting environment value or a setting app value. |

## Setting app value
Setting app value is used to override the setting's default value and any setting environment value for a specific app. Use a setting app value when the setting environment value is not what you want to be used for your app. If a setting environment value does not exist, use a setting app value when the setting's default value is not what you want to be used for your app.

> [!NOTE]
> To follow the steps listed below you need to use the new [app designer](../model-driven-apps/app-designer-overview.md). Currently the app designer only supports adding, updating, or deleting setting app values for Power Apps framework settings. Custom settings created by you will not appear in the app designer.

### Adding or updating a setting app value using the app designer
1. Open the app you wish to add the setting app value for in the [app designer](../model-driven-apps/create-model-driven-app.md#create-an-app).
1. In the command bar, select **Settings**.
1. In the **Settings** dialog, select **Features** tab or the **Upcoming** tab.<br> The **Features** tab shows all settings that have release level set to Generally available. The **Upcoming** tab shows all settings that have release level set to Preview.
1. Add or update an app value for the setting you want.
1. Save and publish the app.

### Deleting a setting app value using the app designer
1. Open the app you wish to remove the setting app value for in the [app designer](../model-driven-apps/create-model-driven-app.md#create-an-app).
1. In the command bar, select **Settings**.
1. In the **Settings** dialog, select **Features** tab or the **Upcoming** tab.
1. Select **Reset to environment value** next to the setting app value you wish to delete. This will make the setting value fall back to the setting environment value if one exists. If no setting environment value exists, it will fallback to the setting's default value.
1. Save and publish the app.

### Adding or updating a setting app value using the solution explorer
1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc).
1. In the navigation pane, select **Solutions**.
1. From the list of solutions, open the solution you want to add the setting app value to.
1. If the setting definition or setting environment value is not available in the solution add one of them. See [**Adding an existing setting definition**](create-edit-configure-settings.md#adding-an-existing-setting-definition) or [**Adding an existing setting environment value**](create-edit-configure-settings.md#adding-an-existing-setting-environment-value).
1. Click on the setting definition or setting environment value.
1. In the **Edit setting value** dialog, in the **Setting app value** section, find the app that you wish to add the setting app value for. Note that using the solution explorer you can only add setting app values for apps that are in the current solution.
1. Provide the value and select **Save**.
1. For the app setting value to take effect you will have to re-publish the app using the app designer or solution explorer.

### Deleting a setting app value using the solution explorer
1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc).
1. In the navigation pane, select **Solutions**.
1. From the list of solutions, open the solution you want to delete the setting app value from.
1. If the setting definition or setting environment value is not available in the solution add one of them. See [**Adding an existing setting definition**](create-edit-configure-settings.md#adding-an-existing-setting-definition) or [**Adding an existing setting environment value**](create-edit-configure-settings.md#adding-an-existing-setting-environment-value).
1. Click on the setting definition or setting environment value.
1. In the **Edit setting value** dialog, in the **Setting app value** section, find the app that you wish to delete the setting app value for. Note that using the solution explorer you can only remove setting app values for apps that are in the current solution.
1. Select the ellipsis "***...***" next to the setting app value and then select **Reset to environment**.
1. Select **Save**.
1. For the deletion of the setting app value to take effect you will have to re-publish the app using the app designer or solution explorer.
