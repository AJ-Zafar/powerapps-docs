# Use Dataverse low-code plug-ins (preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Microsoft Dataverse offers a powerful solution for achieving more efficient data architecture and reducing client-side workload through low-code plug-ins. These plug-ins are reusable, real-time workflows that execute a specific set of commands within Dataverse, running server-side and triggered by personalized event handlers.

Traditionally, plug-ins were created as custom classes compiled into a .NET Framework assembly, which were then uploaded and registered within Dataverse. However, with the introduction of low-code plug-ins, users can now create these event handlers with minimal or no coding required, and without the need for manual registration.

Low-code plug-ins are stored within a Dataverse database and can be seamlessly integrated into Power Apps and Power Automate. The behavior of the workflow is defined using the Power FX expression language and can directly connect with Dataverse business data and external data sources through Power Platform connectors. With low-code plug-ins, users can rapidly construct complex workflows with minimal coding expertise, resulting in a more streamlined and efficient data architecture.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - This is a preview feature. Use this if you're an early adopter, see something useful to you, and would like to help test the feature.
> - Experimental features arenâ€™t meant for production use and may have restricted functionality. These features are available before an official release so that customers can get early access and provide feedback.
> - Experimental features can radically change or completely disappear at any time. For this reason the feature is not enabled by default and you must explicitly opt in to use it.

## Benefits of server-side logic
Defining server-side business logic offers several benefits, including:
1. **Increased security**. Since server-side logic executes on the server, it can help prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data or processes.
2. **Improved performance**. By executing on the server, business logic can reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred between the client and server, resulting in faster processing times.
3. **Consistency and reliability**. Server-side logic ensures that business rules are consistently applied across all clients, reducing the risk of errors or inconsistencies.
4. **Easier maintenance and upgrades**. By centralizing business logic on the server, it becomes easier to maintain and update, as changes can be made in one place rather than having to update multiple clients.
5. **Scalability**. Server-side logic can be scaled more easily than client-side logic, allowing for better performance and handling of larger workloads.

There are two types of low-code plug-ins:

| Type | Trigger | Supports parameters | Supported [scope](/power-apps/developer/data-platform/custom-api#select-a-binding-type) |
|-|-|-|-|
| Instant | Manually run | Yes | Global and table |
| Automated | Dataverse table event | No | Table |

All low-code plug-ins have these common properties:

| Property | Description |
|-|-|
| Display name | The human-readable name of the plug-in. Cannot be changed once created. |
| Name | The internal name of the plug-in. It is used by the platform to identify the component in code and database operations. Cannot be changed once created. |
| Description | Used to provide additional context about the plug-in (purpose, behavior, or other important details). |
| Solution| Used to group components and export to other environments. Learn more about [solutions](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/solutions-overview). |
| Expression | This is the custom function that can be used to perform actions or calculations, defined using the Power FX expression language. Power FX is a formula language used in Power Apps canvas apps, and has been extended to be used in low-code plug-ins. See [supported functions for more details](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/low-code-plug-ins-powerfx).|

# [Instant plug-ins](#tab/instant)

An instant low-code plug-in is custom code logic that's manually triggered by a user. Custom input and output parameters can be used.

Unique properties:

| Property | Description |
|-|-|
| Scope | Used to associate a plug-in to a specific table. It can be set to either table (shown as entity) or global, where table (entity) scope means the plug-in will be triggered with the context of a specific table record, and global scope means the operation is not associated with a table ([learn more](/power-apps/developer/data-platform/custom-api#select-a-binding-type)). |
| Parameters | Parameters allow you to pass information between the plug-in and the context that runs it, making it easier to design business logic that can be reused in varying situations.<br><br>**Input parameters** are used to provide data to the plug-in, and allow you to control how the function behaves by passing in different values you specify in the Power FX formula.<br><br>**Output parameters** allow you to retrieve the results of a function or method for further use in your program.<br><br>Supported data types:<br><ul><li>Boolean<li>String</li><li>Float</li><li>Decimal</li><li>DateTime</li><li>Integer</li></ul>|

# [Automated plug-ins](#tab/automated)
An automated low-code plug-in is custom code that is executed during the processing of a specific data event.

Unique properties:

| Property | Description |
|-|-|
| Data event<br>('Run this plug-in when the row is') | Specifies which data event triggers the plug-in. Any combination of the following events can be selected to invoke the plug-in:<br><ul><li>Create</li><li>Update</li><li>Delete</li>|
| Stage<br>('When should this run') | You can design whether the plug-in runs before or after the data event completes, which allows flexibility to access and modify values in key stages of the event.<br><br><ul><li>**Pre-operation**. Select this option if you want to run your plug-in logic after the form validation, but before the values are inserted or changed in Dataverse.</li><li>**Post operation**. Select this option to run your plug-in logic after the values have been inserted or changed in Dataverse.</li></ul> |

## Plug-in permissions

:::row:::
   :::column span="":::
      **Design time**
      
      Makers who have system customizer or system administrator security role membership in the Power Platform environment can access all plug-ins in that environment. Customize security roles can be used to restrict access to low-code plug-ins.
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="":::
      **Run time**
      
      When a plug-in is invoked, it accesses the table data involved in the plug-in definition (the tables that are part of the formula, or if the table is associated with the settings of an automated plug-in) in the context of the user who invoked it.
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="":::
      **Connections**
      
      Using [security roles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/security-roles-privileges#security-roles-and-the-new-modern-ui), connector access within plug-ins can be restricted to a specific set of users within your organization. You can specify which roles have create, read, update, or delete privileges.

## Use Power Platform connectors in low-code plug-ins

> [!NOTE]
> Not all connector actions are supported at this time.

### Prerequisites for using connectors in low-code plug-ins

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * [Prerequisites for creating a low-code plug-in](#prerequisites-for-creating-a-low-code-plug-in)
> * [Connection reference](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/create-connection-reference) with an active connection. 
<!--- Needs verification > * **Owner** or **can use and share** permission on the connection you want to use (to author the plug-in). --->

### Using connector actions in low-code plug-ins

You can easily use [connectors]( https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/connector-reference/connector-reference-powerapps-connectors) and [custom connectors]( https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/custom-connectors/) from within a low-code plug-in Power FX formula. Here's how:
1. Create a connection to the connector you want to use.
2. [Add a connection reference]( https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/maker/data-platform/create-connection-reference#manually-add-a-connection-reference-to-a-solution-using-solution-explorer) to the connection in the Dataverse environment.
3. In the low-code plug-in Power FX expression editor, type the name of the connection reference.
4. Intellisense will show you the available actions.
5. Select the action you want and enter the required parameters.
Before using a connector in a low-code plug-in, make sure to review the connector's [documentation]( https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/connector-reference/connector-reference-powerapps-connectors) to ensure that you're passing the input and output parameters correctly.

## Smart low-code plug-ins

### What are smart low-code plugi-ns?
Dataverse includes AI-powered actions which can be used to generate or extract data using Azure Open AI and the power of AI Builder. You can call these functions from both instant and automated low-code plug-ins.  

**What functions are supported for smart low-code plug-ins?**

| Function | Description |
| - | - |
| **AISummarize** | Summarize text |
| **AISentiment** | Detect the sentiment of text as either positive, negative, or neutral | 
| **AIReply** | Draft a reply to text | 
| **AITranslate** |  Translate text to English | 
| **AIClassify**| Classify text into one or more provided categories | 
| **AIExtract**| Extract specified entities such as registration numbers | 

### Requirements

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * [Prerequisites for creating a low-code plug-in](#prerequisites-for-creating-a-low-code-plug-in)
> * AI Builder subscription

> [!TIP]
> If you do not have an AI Builder subscription, you can use an [AI Builder trial](/ai-builder/ai-builder-trials). View the AI models page in the Power Apps maker portal to get AI Builder which will direct you to start a trial.

## Test a low-code plug-in

- Manually test the instant plug-in

  1. From the **plug-ins** page, select an instant low-code plug-in from the list, and then select **Test** on the command bar.
  ![image](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/powerapps-docs-pr/assets/43950360/3661b514-2fc2-491d-bcc9-604d77dbe728)
  :::image type="content" source="media/low-code-plugin-test.png" alt-text="Test low-code plug-in":::

  1. Provide values for any input parameters that are defined in the low-code plug-in, and then select **Run**.
  ![image](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/powerapps-docs-pr/assets/43950360/af670bf6-b722-413d-b26b-ca789a68e3c3)
  :::image type="content" source="https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/powerapps-docs-pr/assets/43950360/af670bf6-b722-413d-b26b-ca789a68e3c3" alt-text="Test low-code plug-in":::

  Observe the response.
  
  > [!TIP]
  > Use output parameters to help validate expected behavior and results. Otherwise, you will only see a success or failure when testing.

- You can test automated plug-ins by invoking the data event. Observe if the plug-in ran successfully by validating expected changes that were defined in the formula.

### Integrate a low-code plug-in

#### Invoke an instant plug-in from a canvas app or custom page
1. In the **Dataverse Accelerator** app:
    1. Select the instant plug-in in the list,
    1. Click the 'copy to clipboard' action in the command bar.
    2. Save the copied formula to a text editor or note pad (somewhere you can easily refer back to)
1. In the [Power Apps maker portal](https://make.powerapps.com/):
   1. create or edit a canvas app (or custom page) in the Power Apps studio.
   1. In the left navigation, under the **Data Sources** tab, click **+ New data source** and search for the **Environment** option from the Dataverse connector.
   1. Insert the following components into the canvas:
    - Add input controls that correspond with each parameter's data type (e.g., [Text input](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/controls/control-text-input) for text or numbers, [toggle](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/controls/control-toggle) for boolean)
    - If the plug-in scope is bound to a table, add a combobox that is associated with the same table so you can choose the input. 
    - Add a [button](../canvas-apps/controls/control-button.md) to call the plug-in.
1. Paste the plug-in formula you copied into the button's `OnSelect` property.
1. Map each input parameter `Value` to reference the corresponding input controls
    - If the formula was `Environment.new_CalculateSum({ X: Value, Y: Value });`, it could would be re-written as: `Environment.new_CalculateSum({ X: TextInput1.Text, Y: TextInput2.Text });`
    - If the formula was bound, replace `Environment` with the table display name to access the plug-in.
1. If an output parameter is defined for the low-code plug-in:
    1. Capture the response in a `Set()` or `UpdateContext()` formula: `Set( ActionResult, Environments.CalculateSum({ X: TextInput1.Text, Y: TextInput2.Text }) );`. Display the variable in a label. Alternatively use the `Notify()` formula to display data in a notification.
1. Play the app and click the button to run the low-code plug-in.

Learn more about how you can [call Dataverse actions directly from Power FX in canvas apps](../canvas-apps/connections/connection-common-data-service.md#call-dataverse-actions-directly-in-power-fx-preview).

#### Invoke an instant plug-in from a Power Automate cloud flow
1. In a cloud flow, add a new action from the Microsoft Dataverse connector.
2. Select the action called [Perform an unbound action](/connectors/commondataserviceforapps/#perform-an-unbound-action) or [Perform a bound action](/connectors/commondataserviceforapps/#perform-a-bound-action).
3. Select your plug-in (it will have the unique name with a prefix).
4. Provide values for all of the input parameters (if any).

#### Invoke an instant plug-in from the Dataverse Web API
Follow the steps for **Unbound action** or **Function bound to table** sections in the [Invoking custom APIs from the Web API documentation](/power-apps/developer/data-platform/custom-api#invoking-custom-apis-from-the-web-api) (depending on the appropriate scope of the plug-in).

## Trace logging

Trace logging is a feature in Dataverse that allows you to capture detailed information about the execution of plug-ins. By enabling trace logging, you can get a more complete picture of what's happening during plug-in execution, which can be helpful for troubleshooting issues and identifying performance bottlenecks. When you enable trace logging for plug-ins, Dataverse will generate log files that include information about the plug-in's input and output parameters, as well as any exceptions or errors that occur during execution.

To enable trace logging for plug-ins, you'll need to [enable the trace logging feature for the environment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/developer/data-platform/logging-tracing).

## Contacting Help + support

For issues with the Dataverse Accelerator solution installation or low-code plug-ins, such as errors received, [use the Help + support experience](/power-platform/admin/get-help-support) and include the following information:

- Problem Type- Dataverse Web API and SDK
- Problem Subtype- Accelerator kit for Dataverse

## Example low-code plug-ins you can create

For a few examples of how to create a low-code plug-in, go to [Example Dataverse low-code plug-ins (experimental)](lowcode-plug-ins-examples.md)

## Limitations

- The environment language object needs to be readded to access new plug-ins inside existing canvas apps. For any plug-ins created after you have added the environment table data source to an existing canvas app, you'll have to remove and readd the Power Fx environment language object. Then you'll see the updated list of plug-ins as actions.
- Intellisense requires explicit notation in automated plug-ins if you want to refer any tables in the formula. Use the following disambiguation syntax such as `[@Accounts]`, using square brackets and the `@` symbol (not `Accounts`).
- Nested support. Plug-ins can only call first-party actions published by Microsoft from Power Fx expressions. In the future, plug-ins will be able to call other user-defined plug-ins.
- Some `Collect` scenarios require `Patch`. There are some scenarios where `Collect()` doesn't work. The workaround is to use `Patch()` as shown in the populating regarding column example below. If you're creating an automated plug-in, prepend @ to each table referenced in the Power Fx formula.
    ```powerapps-dot
    Patch(Faxes,
        Collect(Faxes, { Subject : "Sub1" } ),
        { Regarding : First(Accounts) }
    )
    ```
- When low-code plug-ins interact with connectors and DLP is employed, the admin can block creation of connections using DLP. However, existing connection references in the Dataverse environment will continue to function. In case the admin needs to block all low-code plug-in interactions with any connectors, they can simply disable the organization setting `Allowconnectorsonpowerfxactions`. This setting is enabled by default and can be disabled by usual SDK means (WebAPI, SDK, Powershell, etc). Customers can disable this using a low-code instant plug-in as follows:
   ```powerapps-dot
   Patch(Organizations, First(Organizations), { 'Enable connectors on power fx actions.': 'Enable connectors on power fx actions. (Organizations)'.No })
   ```
- Plug-ins that use connectors can only output results from specific fields. Due to this, you need to map specific primitive values from the connector response to output values.
