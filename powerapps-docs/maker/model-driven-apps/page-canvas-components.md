# Add canvas components to a custom page for your model-driven app 

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

This topic outlines the use of canvas components using canvas component libray for a custom page. 

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > - This is a preview feature, and may not be available in all regions.
  > - [!INCLUDE[cc_preview_features_definition](../../includes/cc-preview-features-definition.md)]

  > [!NOTE]
  > Custom page currently supports only a [limited set of controls](/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/design-page-for-model-app#supported-controls-in-custom-page) and only these  supported controls should be used to create canvas components for the custom page. 


Canvas components provides app makers an ability to create custom components in a low code fashion. These components can not only then be reused across custom pages and applications but also can be centrally updated, packaged and moved in the Dataverse solutions. See [create a component for canvas apps](/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/create-component) for more details on how to create a component. Since custom page authoring is limited to only one page, canvas components can only be authored inside a [component library](/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/component-library). This is different from the standalone canvas apps which additionally has ability to create components at the app level.

## Create a canvas component using component library 
You can create a new [component library](/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/component-library) or edit an existing one either from the Solutions area or Maker portal.  Browse to [make.powerapps.com](https://make.powerapps.com), select **Apps**, and then select **Component Libraries**:

## Create canvas component for use in custom page 
### Enabling modern controls for component library 
You would need to enable modern controls in component library for use inside custom page. Please make sure that only the [supported set of controls](/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/design-page-for-model-app#supported-controls-in-custom-page) is used to create components for custom page. You can enable the modern controls in the canvas component library settings for use in custom pages.

### Creating a canvas component 
Once the modern controls are enabled in the studio, you can now [create desired components](/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/create-component.md) inside the library and publish it when ready.
