# Power Apps grid control (preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

The Power Apps grid control lets app users make rich in-line editing directly from views and sub-grids. The control supports the latest Microsoft Accessibility Standards and is built to be performant and easily extensible for the future. The Power Apps grid control also aligns with the latest Microsoft design guidance for fonts, sizing, and styling. The Power Apps grid control will eventually replace the editable grid control in both model-driven and canvas apps.

## Configure the Power Apps grid control for table views

When you configure the grid control for a table, *all* views for that table will display using the Power Apps grid control.

1. Open [solution explorer](powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/advanced-navigation#solution-explorer).
1. Expand **Entities**, in the list of tables, open the table you want, select the **Controls** tab, and then select **Add Control**.
1. In the **Add Control** dialog box, select **Power Apps Grid**, and then select **Add**.

1. In the **Power Apps Grid** row that's added, select the app types you want to apply the grid to. This makes the control the default control for the selected clients.

1. To display an alphabetic list in views or subgrids, select the pencil icon in the **Jump bar** row, and then under **Bind to static options**, select **Enable** in the dropdown list. By default the jump bar is disabled. Below is a screenshot of the jump bar enabled for the contact table in a model-driven app.

## Configure a subgrid to use the Power Apps grid control

1. Open [solution explorer](powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/advanced-navigation#solution-explorer).
1. Open the form that contains the sub-grid.
1. Select the subgrid where you want configure the Power Apps grid control, and then select **Change Properties** on the command bar.
