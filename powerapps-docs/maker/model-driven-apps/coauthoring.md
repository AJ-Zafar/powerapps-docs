# Coauthoring in model-driven apps (preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Coauthoring allows multiple makers—whether pro or citizen developer—to make changes to the app at the same time and see those changes in real time. As a result, teams can innovate together and build stronger connections between professional developers and business domain experts, a critical ingredient to maximizing low-code development.
