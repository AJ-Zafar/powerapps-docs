# Overview of the model-driven app designer

The new model-driven app designer provides a modern WYSIWYG authoring experience when you work with model-driven apps. The designer includes several improvements not available in the classic model-driven app designer.

The designer shows a real-time WYSIWYG preview while you author an app. Changes to the app are instantly reflected in the preview, enabling you to see exactly how the app will appear to users when published.

The app designer interface has the following areas:

1. Command bar – Displays available actions:

- New page. Create a new page for one or more table forms and views or table dashboards for the app.
- Settings. Opens the app properties such as name, description, and whether the app can be used offline.
- Switch to classic. Opens the app in the classic app designer.
- Save. Saves the app.
- Publish. Makes the app available to users in the environment.
- Preview. Opens a new tab to view the app at run time in a full browser window.

2.App preview – Displays a real-time preview of the form as it will appear to users when published.

3.Panes - The left navigation pane consists of the following areas:

- Navigation. Displays a site map view of your app that is formed using areas, groups, and subareas. 
- Data. Provides a view of all available data that’s currently included in your app or is available to add from your Dataverse environment. 

4.Property pane – Displays properties of the selected component, and also allows you to make changes.
