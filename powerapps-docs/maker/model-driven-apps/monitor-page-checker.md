# Use Monitor to troubleshoot custom page behavior in a model-driven app

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Monitor can help you debug and diagnose problems, which helps you build faster, more reliable apps. Monitor provides a deep view into how an app runs by providing a log of all activities in your app as it runs.

When you filter on model-driven app custom page-related events in Monitor, you can get information about related tables, tables, controls, and components on a custom page in Monitor as your app runs.
