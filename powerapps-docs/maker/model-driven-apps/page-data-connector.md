# Add connectors to a custom page for your model-driven app (preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

This topic outlines the use of Power Apps connectors within a custom page.  The most common connectors are being verified and status is available in this page.  This page also includes any known issues for connectors in custom pages. 

Publishing a model-driven app with custom pages will consolidate all of the connections within the app. This connector consolidation allows for a single consent prompt for all of the connectors at the start of the app.

## Verified connectors for custom pages

| Connector | Status | Notes |
|--|--|--|
| [Office 365 Users](../canvas-apps/connections/connection-office365-users.md) | Verified |
| [Outlook](../canvas-apps/connections/connection-office365-outlook.md) | Verified |
| [SharePoint Online](../canvas-apps/connections/connection-sharepoint-online.md) | Verified |
| [SQL Server](../canvas-apps/connections/connection-azure-sqldatabase.md) | Verified | Includes AAD Auth, Sql Server Auth, Windows Auth, and Windows Auth non-shared | 
| Power Automate | Verified |
| [Teams](/connectors/teams/) | Verified |
| [Custom connector](../canvas-apps/register-custom-api.md) | Verified |
| [Excel Online for Business](../canvas-apps/connections/connection-excel.md) | Verified |  |
| [Excel via file share](../canvas-apps/connections/connection-excel.md) | Partial | Verified Excel stored in only one of either OneDrive, Box, Dropbox, or Google Drive for a model-driven app |

Note: connectors on the supported list are expected to work with on-prem gateway

## Upcoming changes to connectors for custom pages

* Environment variable support for connections
* Connection References support for shared connections

## Known issues

* No support to enable bypassing Microsoft connectors
* Unable to use Excel stored in two or more of OneDrive, Box, Dropbox, or Google Drive within a single model-driven app.  The new Excel Online connector doesn't have this limitation.
* Cross environment Dataverse connections can be used but the consent prompt is not shown
