# Build an app in 3 steps (preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../../../../../repos/powerapps-docs-pr/powerapps-docs/includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

This interactive experience shows new makers how to build model-driven app for the first time. Using the modern app designer, quickly create and play an app in three simple steps.



## How it works

New makers will see the new tutorial banner when these conditions are true:

* You have permission to create a Microsoft Dataverse database in the environment.
* You have not yet created and saved an app.

Makers who donâ€™t meet these conditions can experience this feature in a preview environment by adding this parameter to the end of the make.preview.powerapps.com URL: ?cdsCommon.forcePowerAppsFirstRunTour=true
