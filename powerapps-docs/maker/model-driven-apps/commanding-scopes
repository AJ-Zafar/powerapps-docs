# Scopes for modern commands (preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Commands may have one of three types of scopes. The scope determines how broadly a command will render. For example, if the command should only render within one app, within all apps that share a particular table, or within all apps and all tables for a specific command bar location.

- **App** This is the default behavior when creating or editing commands using command designer. The command will only be present within the model-driven app command designer was opened from.
- **Table** Also known as entity scope. Table scoped commands will be present within all apps in an environment. They are bound to the table and command bar location. For example, a table scope command for the Account table and Main form location will be present in all apps when viewing the main form for an account record.
- **Global** This is the broadest scope. Global scope commands are bound to a command bar location. They are Not associated with any table or app. For example, a global scope command for the Main form location will be present in all apps when viewing the main form for all tables.

## Override Table (Entity) and Global Scoped commands

- An **App Scoped** command overrides Table (Entity) and Global scoped commands in context of particular App. Commands edited using moder command designer will create a copy (instance) of the command will app scope. For example, editing a Global scope command will replace the original command for the specific app, location, and table. Other apps and tables will render the original global scope command. 
- A **Table (Entity) scoped** command overrides Global scoped commands.
