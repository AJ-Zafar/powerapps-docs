# Design a custom page for your model-driven app (preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

This topic provides tips to design a custom page for use in a model-driven app.

## Supported controls in custom page
Custom page authoring will start with a subset of controls supported and will be gradually adding more controls. Interaction with controls currently not supported may change so they should not be used until they are officially supported.

  | Control | Control Type | Notes |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  |Label<sup>1</sup>|Display||
  |Text Box<sup>1</sup>|Input||
  |Date Picker<sup>1</sup>|Input|
  |Button<sup>1</sup>|Input|
  |Combo Box<sup>1</sup>|Input|
  |Check Box<sup>1</sup>|Input|

  > [!Note]
  >  <sup>1</sup> - Controls with superscript "1"  are the new modern controls which were introduced for [canvas apps in Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform-release-plan/2020wave1/microsoft-powerapps/build-apps-teams-modern-controls); These controls are based on [Fluent UI library](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui#/controls/web) wrapped with [Power Apps Component Framework](../../developer/component-framework/overview.md). 

Additionally you can add both low-code and pro-code custom UX compoennts to your environment and make them available for all makers. For custom component samples please visit [code components OOB samples](../../developer/component-framework/use-sample-components.md), [code components community resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/developer/component-framework/community-resources) and [canvas component gallery.](https://powerusers.microsoft.com/t5/Canvas-Apps-Components-Samples/bd-p/ComponentsGallery)

## Enable responsive layout with Container control

Responsive custom page layouts are defined by building a hierarchy of **Horizontal layout container** and **Vertical layout container** controls.  These controls are found under sidebar Insert > Layout.

Resize the topmost container to fill the entire space with these properties. 

  ```powerappsfl
  X=0
  Y=0
  Width=Parent.Width
  Height=Parent.Height
  ```

Learn more about at [Building responsive layout](../canvas-apps/build-responsive-apps.md "Building responsive layout").

### Vertical Container with fixed header, flexible body, fixed footer

1. On the **Vertical Container**, set **Align (horizontal)** to **Stretch**

1. Insert three **Horizontal Container** controls within the parent **Vertical Container**

1. On the first and third child horizontal container controls, set **Stretch height** off and reduce height to space needed (for example, Height=80)

### Horizontal Container with two even child containers

1. On the parent horizontal container, set **Align (vertical)** to **Stretch**

1. Insert two **Vertical Container** controls within the parent **Horizontal Container**

## Styling custom page controls to align to model-driven app controls

By creating the custom page from the modern app designer, the important properties are defaulted.  

1. Controls need to use different Font size based on their position in the page hierarchy

    > [!Note]
    > custom page text has a up scaling of 1.33 so need to divide target FontSize by 1.33 to get the desired size


    | Label Type | Target FontSize | FontSize to use |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    |Page title|17|12.75|
    |Normal labels|14|10.52|
    |Small labels|12|9.02|

1. Primary and secondary button controls need the following styling changes

    Primary buttons:
    ```powerappsfl
    Color=RGBA(255, 255, 255, 1)
    Fill=RGBA(41,114,182,1)
    Height=35
    FontWeight=Normal
    ```

    Secondary buttons:
    ```powerappsfl
    Color=RGBA(41,114,182,1)
    Fill=RGBA(255, 255, 255, 1)
    BorderColor=RGBA(41,114,182,1)
    Height=35
    FontWeight=Normal
    ```

1. Theme defaulting 
   
    Custom page studio editor does not has explicit theme selector. Theme values for the controls is automatically set to match the default blue theme of the unified interface. We will enhace the custom page theme integration in future releases to match the hosting model-application theming.
