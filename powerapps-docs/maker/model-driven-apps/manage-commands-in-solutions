# Manage commands in solutions

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

- Add things that depend on it
- Block commands from being customized (managed properties)*
- View dependencies
- Troubleshoot by viewing which solutions modified the component and when (solution layers)*
- Remove any unmanaged customizations if in an unhealthy state
- Add or remove from solution
- Segment solutions and ship minor updates or patches
